0,1-2-Switch,/wiki/1-2-Switch," 1-2-Switch is a party game in which players do not usually rely on what is happening on-screen, but rather make use of audio cues and the functionality of the Switch's Joy-Con controllers to play in several different games. It features 28 different minigames, most of which involve two players, who each use one of the Joy-Con controllers and are often encouraged to look at each other during gameplay. Aside from tutorial videos for each game, players mostly rely solely on audio cues and feedback from the Joy-Con's rumble feature to indicate how well they are performing.  "
1,10 Second Ninja X,/wiki/10_Second_Ninja_X," 10 Second Ninja X is a sidescrolling puzzle platformer. The game follows a ninja who must destroy robots at high pace within a set time frame of 10 seconds.[1] Every level is set with a timer, with the player having to finish the level within 10 seconds. The player has several attacks, including a projectile, that has limited capacity. Each level finishes when the player has destroyed all targets onscreen. The game features different star ratings for completed levels, with higher stars given for completing the missions in faster times.[8]  "
2,13 Sentinels Aegis Rim,/wiki/13_Sentinels_Aegis_Rim," 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim is a video game where players take control of thirteen different characters, who interact with each other to build a larger narrative.[2] The gameplay is split into three sections: Remembrance, with exploration and dialogue taking priority and advancing the narrative; Destruction, where characters equip mecha and engage in pausable real-time battles against enemies; and Analysis, a glossary which documents event scenes and important items and characters.[3][4]  During the Remembrance segments, the player explores two-dimensional (2D) side-scrolling environments, interacting with elements of those environments in a non-linear manner. Several elements move in real-time regardless of the player's actions, and choices can be made which alter the outcome of some scenes. Keywords spoken by characters and obtained items are added to a Thought Cloud database, which can be accessed to trigger both internal monologues and initiate new dialogue.[1][2][5] Once learned, keywords are carried over into other earlier or parallel scenes, which in turn unlock further story routes and options.[6] These sections employ a visual novel narrative structure.[7] The character stories are tracked with a flowchart, with players able to jump between scenes to try different keywords from the Thought Cloud. If a wrong choice is made during one section, the game rewinds back to the beginning of the day so players can select the right choice. To reach that point faster, events the player has already seen can be fast forwarded.[8]  The battle system of the Destruction mode takes the form of a real-time strategy scenario, with up to six chosen characters using Sentinels to fight off waves of enemies called Kaiju defending a terminal.[1][9] The terminal's health is determined by which units are in place, and if all units are defeated, the hub is overwhelmed and the game ends. can be paused, allowing for Sentinels to be moved and actions such as combat and support abilities to be carried out. The section is completed when the hub is successfully defended against all waves.[10][11] Battles pit Sentinels against Kaiju with differing strengths and abilities such as flight or extra defense, requiring one of the four Sentinel types; some Sentinels are strong against flying enemies, while others do better against large ground-based forces. They also have different attack ranges and movement speeds.[1][8] Sentinels have at least one basic attack that costs nothing, and additional abilities that cost a resource called EP; EP can be recovered by defending. After acting, each Sentinel has a cooldown timer before it can act again. Damage can be repaired by Sentinel pilots, but this requires leaving the Sentinel and leaving them vulnerable to attack.[1] The player can also trigger limited-use ""Terminal Commands"", special field-wide abilities such as an EMP which use up a dedicated energy gauge.[8] Characters level up with experience points and gain passive bonus effects, while Sentinel abilities and attributes can be raised using Meta-chips gained during battles.[6][10]  Analysis takes the form of an index where event scenes and information on people, items and concepts are archived. Mystery Points, earned through Destruction mode, are used to unlock new index entries in Analysis.[6] As the player advances, character narratives are locked off until something else has taken place in another section of the game. These unlock conditions can include unlocking entries in Analysis, advancing stories in Remembrance, or tackling particular battles in Destruction.[6][10][12]  "
3,140,/wiki/140_(video_game)," As described by Carlsen, 140 is ""an old school platformer"", but where the challenge is ""in syncing up your moves and jumps to the music-controlled elements""; as the player progresses through a level, the music will change to reflect the difficulty of the platforming elements.[3] The player controls a geometric shape—a square when stationary, a circle when moving, and a triangle when jumping—across a two-dimensional environment made up of other simple geometric shapes, with the objective being to reach the end of the course. Along the way the player will need to collect floating colored balls that, when placed in a semicircular fixture on the ground, activate a new type of platforming obstacle that allows the player to continue. These activations have the effects of changing the color palette of the level and adding a new element to the music to which the new obstacle is synchronized.  Various obstacles and enemies, represented by geometric shapes, test the player's skills, and should the shape fall or be hit by one of the shapes filled with white noise, they will need to restart at the last checkpoint they passed. All of these obstacles and enemies have actions that are synchronized to the music, aiding the player in moving through the course; platforms that move or appear and disappear will do so on the beat, while enemies will fire in time to the music.[5]  "
5,198X,/wiki/198X," In an introductory sequence entitled Beating Heart that plays like a side-scrolling beat 'em up, the teenage protagonist fights their way from the subway station and through the streets of the unnamed city in which they live until they reach a hospital where they are attacked by a hooded figure with glowing red eyes.  Set in the 1980s, the game follows the Kid, the teenager from the introduction, who feels stuck in their childhood home in ""sleepy suburbia"" as they wait for their life to ""move forward"". One night, as the Kid wanders the streets of their unnamed city looking for anything to ""make my heart skip a beat again"", they stumble across an abandoned factory that was built ""long before"" the protagonist was born and now houses an arcade. Wondering if they found a place where they can fit in, they start playing a horizontally scrolling space shooter entitled ""Out of the Void"". Feeling disconnected at school, the Kid's mind frequently returns to the arcade where they were ""on an asteroid somewhere fighting space invaders."" The only person they notice in school is ""her"", a ""punk rocker from the south district"" whose freedom the Kid admires. The story then cuts to the Kid playing an arcade racing game entitled ""The Runaway"". During ""The Runaway""'s second stage, the Kid explains that they've started to spend every night at the arcade, where every game they mastered made them ""stronger"" and ""more confident"". One evening, the Kid reminisces about their childhood and how ""anything was possible"" back then before ""everyone got brainwashed"" in high school. They then mention how as a kid, ""shadows seem darker and more terrifying"" yet ""more exciting"" at the same time. The game then transitions to a ninja video game called ""Shadowplay"". That night, while walking to the arcade, the Kid reveals that their parents split up due to an incident involving the Kid's father.   They also mention that night was when ""everything changed"" at the arcade before 198X transitions into a role-playing video game entitled ""Kill Screen"" where the player has to defeat 3 dragons in order to solve a maze before fighting the unwinnable SHODAN-like final boss. Afterwards the Kid is seen sitting outside the arcade in the rain mentioning everything ""was still there"" but that ""nothing was the same"". Characters from 198X's various games begin to materialize around the Kid, with them concluding that the ""game was not over"".  "
7,20XX,/wiki/20XX_(video_game)," Inspired by Mega Man X, players must defeat enemies and complete difficult platforming challenges to finish a stage. The twist is that these stages are generated randomly based on level segments, or ""chunks"", and allow for both local and online co-op.[1] Rather than giving several lives, the game has permadeath, but is a ""roguelite"" in that the player can use Soul Chips earned during the level to unlock new types of passive upgrades to buy, and gain upgrades for the next attempt of that particular run.[4]  During levels players can use bolts gained as currency to buy passive upgrades, or to gain back health or energy in vending machines. They can find upgrades in treasure chests and other places.[4] Upon beating a boss the player can choose to take their power as a reward, granting them a new special ability, or take a reward of bolts or a random passive upgrade instead.[4]   The game follows Nina, an armored girl armed with a power blaster, and Ace, an armored boy who has an energy sword, in the aftermath of a robotic uprising.[1]  Traveling from their base on the Ark, a space station orbiting the Earth, they have been hired to clear dangerous locations that are infested with robots that have run amok.

9,60 Seconds!,/wiki/60_Seconds!," 60 Seconds! takes place in the United States during the 1960s. The game follows the McDoodle family (Ted, Dolores, Mary Jane, and Timmy) as they try to survive the effects of a nuclear apocalypse for as long as possible.  First, the player has the titular 60 seconds to acquire whatever supplies, family members, and diversional items (e.g. a checkers set), and bring them to an underground shelter beneath their house, including the family member they initially control, before a nuclear bomb is dropped on the neighborhood and detonates. Failure to do so affects the flow of the gameplay.  Each day, the player must make decisions for the family based on supplies available, limited information, or ability of family members. Some of these entail risks, and may result in poor health or even death of one or all of the family members.  For consumable supplies, the player must ration their usage, such as food and water among the family members, based on how much they initially acquired, their overall health, and their need for it. The player must also be cautious about the mental state of the family members, as the isolation of the shelter affects the gameplay as well. (e.g. Ted will turn one of his socks into a puppet and begin talking to it as if it was a person.)  At times, a character may be required to leave the shelter to scavenge for supplies and food. Again, this entails risk, as a family member may fall ill from the radiation outside, or may not come back because of an event resulting in the character's death.  Other times, a knock may be heard at the hatch of the underground shelter, and the player must make a decision on whether to ignore it, or open the hatch to allow whoever or whatever is there to interact with the characters. Depending on the event, this may result in a possible trade between the McDoodles and other affected families, or a shelter raid where supplies are stolen, or a mutant entering the shelter and mutating the family, ending the game.  If the player makes a decision at the right time, then there is the possibility of the U.S. Army coming to rescue the family, successfully ending the game.  "
10,6180 the moon,/wiki/6180_the_moon," The player controls the Moon, shown as a simple white circle. The Moon only has the ability to jump and move left and right, however, the tops and the bottom of the level boundaries loop, giving the player more options to tackle the platforming challenges the game presents. The goal of each level is to get from the starting point to the exit block. Every level is grouped into a certain ""world"" each of which is based on a planet (it also includes the Sun), with each world having a different thematic mechanic.   The Moon prepares to set and allow the Sun to rise, however, the Moon notices the Sun is missing. The Moon then begins a journey to find the Sun, and tell him to come back to Earth. On the way, the Moon talks to each of the planets, who give their opinions or advice on the situation. At the end, the Sun tells the Moon that he never left, and the Moon begins the journey back.  "
11,7 Billion Humans,/wiki/7_Billion_Humans," Similar to Human Resource Machine, players are tasked with over 60 programming puzzles, typically involving the movement of numerical data cubes by human workers. For example, a task might ask the player to program the humans to sort the numbers on data cubes in order. The programming language is similar to assembly language, allowing for simple loops, logic, memory storage and calculations. As with its predecessor, the code can be edited in a textual form by copying-and-pasting.  The same program is used to control all humans simultaneously, while allowing each human to follow its individual logic through the project based on their current state, such as moving left or right based on comparing the value of the data cube they are holding. The humans will run through the program until either the program solution is met, or all the humans reach the end of the program and the problem solution is not met, in which case the player must rework the program. The player is able to step through the program and select any individual human to watch their progress through the program for debugging purposes.  Once a player achieves a working solution for a given problem, the game will then simulate 25 additional cases where random factors (such as values of data cubes) change, which might cause a program to fail and require the player to account for that. Otherwise, the player is then ranked on the number of program steps they have, and the number of seconds (cycles) it takes for the program to complete, measured against average marks determined by Tomorrow Corporation. Most levels provide two optional challenges, to beat the average steps and average seconds with optimization of their program; these are sometimes diametric goals and do not need to be completed within the same program. Other puzzles are fully optional, requiring more advanced techniques to solve.[4][5][1][6]  "

After leaving London on an underwater train to Paris or a mail carriage to Cambridge, the player can choose their own route around the world, travelling from city to city. Each city and journey contains unique narrative content. The developers estimate that on one complete circumnavigation of the globe players will see approximately 2% of the game's 750,000 words of textual content.[4][5]  In their role as valet, players must manage finances, their master's health, and time as well as buying and selling items in different markets around the globe. The choices made by the player in story sections can also have a large impact on how the journey proceeds.[6]  The game has several secrets, easter eggs and hidden endings, as well as several references to Verne's works, including Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and From the Earth to the Moon.[7] The game is partly inspired by the steampunk genre, featuring such elements as sapient mechanical transport, hovercraft, submersibles and a city that walks on four gigantic legs.  "
13,9 Monkeys of Shaolin,/wiki/9_Monkeys_of_Shaolin," There are five enemy clans in the in Wokou in the game, one for each chapter.

17,Aaero,/wiki/Aaero," The basic controls are that of a twin-stick shooter, the left stick controlling the ship while the right controls targeting.  Mike Fahey of Kotaku says: ""Aaero sees players navigating through alien environments in a futuristic flying craft. As the music plays, ribbons of light bend and twist in the air, visualizing aspects of the song. Sometimes it's vocals. Sometimes it's strange electronic wails. Using the left analog stick (required even in the PC version), players must grind against those ribbons in order to absorb the energy of the music.""[3]  He goes on to describe the shooting element of the gameplay: ""The game's tunnel-like environments warp and twist to impede the player, each new level bringing unique obstacles and traps into play. Odd mechanical enemies attack from time to time, with the game employing a target lock and fire mechanic using a combination of right analog and trigger.""[4]  In his review for Forbes, Mitch Wallace describes the gameplay: ""The general on-rail, twin-stick shooting setup is deceptively simple: Pilot a nondescript spaceship through various alien and possibly post-apocalyptic stages, gunning down enemies and tracing ribbons of light as you go.""[5]  "
18,Absolute Drift,/wiki/Absolute_Drift," Absolute Drift features 5 free roam areas and 34 tracks.

19,Abyss of the Sacrifice,/wiki/Abyss_of_the_Sacrifice," Abyss of the Sacrifice has two modes of gameplay. The first mode requires little interaction on the player's part as much of the player's time will be spent on reading the text that appears on the game's screen. These lines of text represents either the inner thoughts of the characters or the conversation the characters are having with one another. After a stage has been completed, the player will be presented with a screen displaying the possible stages that the player can advance to.[2] Stages that have been completed will be highlighted in blue whereas those that have not been played will be in orange.[2] Each row of stages has a character's name attached to it which will determine which character will be the main character. As stages are completed, more stages will become available.[2] The ending of the game will differ based on the stages that have been selected.[2]  The second mode is more closely connected to adventure games. The player is tasked with the need to investigate different scenes to find clues and items.[1] It is even possible to combine items together to create new items.[1] The player will then try to solve the puzzles in the game using the information and items they have acquired.[2]   "
20,Abzû,/wiki/Abz%C3%BB," In Abzû, the player takes on the role of a diver in a vast ocean—after waking up floating on the ocean's surface, the diver begins exploring the surrounding underwater environments filled with plant and animal life, in addition to uncovering ancient technology and submerged ruins.[2][3] In a few areas, the diver is also able to explore land-based environments above the water.[4] As the game progresses, the diver unlocks new areas and pursues the secrets behind the forces harming the local environment.[5] The diver's course through the game follows a linear path through interconnected areas filled with marine life.[2] The player directs the diver through the environments using full analogue control, able to interact with the environment to solve switch or item-based puzzles, and the ability to meditate which grants the character the ability to sit on the shark-shaped pedestals within each area to observe the surrounding sea life.

23,Actraiser Renaissance,/wiki/Actraiser_Renaissance," The player plays as ""The Master"", the main protagonist of the game. Although the Master is never directly controlled, the player interacts with the world by controlling an angel and an animated statue. The player plays as an angel during the simulation sequences of the game, and as the statue during the action sequences.  The overhead-view simulation mode involves protecting and guiding the Master's new civilization towards prosperity, beginning with two humans. This portion of the game requires the player to take actions that encourage the growth of the population, including road planning and using lightning, rain, sunlight, wind, and earthquakes as miracles. The Angel can interact with the monsters in the area by shooting them with arrows as well as aid the Master by indicating where to build and use miracles.  One obstacle in the simulation mode is the presence of flying monsters that attempt to impede the progression of a civilization. The monsters originate from four lairs around the region at the beginning of each level. They continuously spawn the creatures as the servant kills them. As the population expands, it can seal the lairs of monsters, which prevents them from spawning, and eventually eliminate all the flying monsters in the land. Doing so increases the civilization level of the region, allowing more advanced structures to be built and increasing the potential population. Once all four lairs have been sealed the population will begin to build the most advanced homes available to the people in that region. The Master levels up by increasing the total population of the world, granting an increase in hit points and SP, used in performing miracles.  Each area has two side-scrolling action sequences, one before the building simulation and near the end. In the action sequences, the player controls a humanlike statue brought to life by the Master. The player must jump from platform to platform while defeating monsters to accrue a score. At the end of each action sequence, the player must defeat a boss.  The final level is an action-sequence boss marathon, culminating in the final fight against Tanzra.   The plot follows a godlike being known only as ""The Master"" (God in the Japanese version) in his fight against Tanzra (Satan in the Japanese version), also referred to as ""The Evil One"". According to the instruction booklet, The Master was defeated in a battle with Tanzra and his six lieutenants. The Master retreated to his sky palace to tend to his wounds and fell into a deep sleep. In the Master's absence, Tanzra divided the world into six lands, one for each of his lieutenants; they later turned the people to evil.  After several hundred years, the Master awakens fully recovered to discover that he has lost his powers due to the lack of belief in him. As the game progresses, the Master defeats Tanzra's lieutenants and recovers his powers by rebuilding the civilizations of his people and communicating with them through prayer. After all lieutenants have been slain, the Master commences an assault on Tanzra's stronghold, Death Heim, eventually defeating him.  After the defeat of Tanzra, The Master and his servant revisit the many civilizations that they had helped to build and observe the people. During their observations, they note that nobody is at the temple worshiping the Master. The servant observes that, although the people once prayed to the Master in times of trouble, they no longer feel a need to because they are not in danger. The Master and his servant then enter the sky palace and depart into the heavens to await a time when they may be needed.  "

After procuring an invite to Lucifer's party, Milo and Lola meet the host himself, who demands they prove their abilities by obtaining seals of approval from his brothers and sisters, the Monarchs of Hell.  One of the Monarchs is Apollyon, a judge of the Dead. Milo and Lola sneak into a demons-only bar to find her. Apollyon sees through their disguises and agrees to give them a seal if they serve as lawyers for Roberto, a soul charged with serial murder. Milo and Lola can either throw the trial per Apollyon's wishes, or let Roberto ascend to heaven and challenge Apollyon afterward; either way, Apollyon will give the pair her seal.  Another Monarch is the hard-partying Asmodeus, who is trying to forget about his recent breakup with his ex, Beth. Milo and Lola can either get Asmodeus and Beth back together or beat Asmodeus in a dance-off to obtain the necessary seal.  Having obtained the needed seals, Milo and Lola return to Satan's party, with a team of challengers drawn from the people they have befriended during the night. Apollyon attempts an intervention, feeling that Satan's drinking is out of control and Hell is suffering because of it, but Satan angrily teleports Milo and Lola away to continue the drinking contest.  The game has multiple endings, depending on Milo and Lola's performance in the drinking game. If they win, they are sent back to Earth and resume their lives. If they lose the contest or refuse to play, they remain in Hell. Some time afterward, Milo and Lola relax at a bar and discuss the current situation; depending on the player's actions, Satan can be recovering from his addictions or have fallen off the wagon, but Hell appears to be running better. Sam bursts in, having discovered another way to possibly escape Hell, to which Milo and Lola immediately agree.  "

35,Air,/wiki/Air_(video_game)," Air is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of three characters.[1] Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. Air follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.[1] With the consumer ports, if an undesired choice was selected, there would be an option to rewind the story to correct the mistake. However, if the player reaches a bad end to a storyline, the player does not have this option and must reload the game at the last saved point.  There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, three which are initially available and two more which can later become available.[1] Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made.

When first playing the game, the player assumes the role of Yukito Kunisaki and the scenarios for the three heroines are available in what is called the Dream story arc. After the plot lines for these three heroines have been completed, an additional scenario called Summer is made available where the player assumes the role of Ryūya. Summer is a linear novel arc in which no choices are presented to the player.[2] Upon the completion of the Summer route, another scenario called Air is made available, which serves as the true ending to the story. In Air, the player assumes the role of a crow named Sora.[1] In the adult versions of the game, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Yukito and a given heroine having sex.[3] Later, Key released versions of Air without the erotic content.[3]   "
39,Alan Wake Remastered,/wiki/Alan_Wake," Alan Wake is described by Remedy as ""the mind of a psychological thriller"" and ""the body of a cinematic action game"" put together.[2][3] In interviews, the game's creators hold that the game does not belong squarely in the survival horror video game genre.[4] The game is primarily set in the fictional idyllic small town of Bright Falls, Washington. The main gameplay happens in various areas of Bright Falls – such as the forest, a national park, or a farm – during the night time; these are punctuated by calmer, non-combative sequences set during the day.  The player controls the eponymous protagonist Alan Wake. In the game, a ""darkness"" is taking over humans, animals and objects. These enemies, dubbed the ""Taken"", are murderous shadows that attack Wake, wielding weapons of their own, ranging from mallets and knives to shovels and chainsaws. They vary by speed, size, and the amount of damage they can take, and some can teleport between short distances.[5] Besides the Taken, the player must combat flocks of possessed ravens and animated objects. When enemies are close, Alan can perform a slow-motion cinematic dodge maneuver.  The Taken are protected by a shield of darkness, initially rendering them impervious to attack; they can only be injured with a firearm after exposure to light, which burns the darkness away. This puts significant emphasis on flashlights in conjunction with conventional weapons, such as a revolver or shotgun. Flashlight beams act as a reticle.[5] The handheld lights Wake can carry can be boosted, which destroys the darkness faster, but also reduces the light's battery level. Besides the conventional shooter gameplay need for reloading ammunition, the player must also insert fresh batteries into the flashlight when they run out, or wait for it to recharge slowly. The strength of the darkness protecting an enemy can vary among the Taken. The amount of darkness ""shield"" remaining on an enemy is represented by a corona of light that appears when aiming at an enemy. Instead of traditional health bars, this shield is represented by a circle that decreases in diameter as it weakens. A stronger darkness may recharge over time.[5] When a Taken is finally destroyed, it disappears.  The player is often encouraged to take advantage of environmental light sources and placing, and to use other light-based weapons and accessories, such as flare guns, hand-held flares and flashbangs. Wake can use searchlights to take out massive waves of Taken. Streetlights and other light stands can provide a safe haven, which the Taken cannot enter, and will regenerate the character's health faster. Otherwise, health regenerates slowly with time, when not taking any damage.[5] In certain sections of the game, it is possible to use a car to traverse between locations in Bright Falls. When in a car, the player can run down Taken on the road, or boost the vehicle's headlights to destroy them.  A major element of gameplay is the optional discovery and collection of manuscript pages from Alan Wake's latest novel—Departure. Although Wake does not remember writing this book, its storyline seems to be becoming real around him. These readable manuscript pages are scattered around the game world, out of chronological order; they often describe scenes that have yet to occur and act as warning and instructions for proceeding through upcoming challenges.[6] Other optional collectibles include coffee thermos flasks scattered around the game world (100 in all), as well as discovering television sets which show different episodes of the fictional Night Springs series, radios airing talk and music from Bright Falls' local radio station, and textual signs around the town.[6] The radio shows and signs provide a deeper understanding of the town's history and culture. The game's downloadable content episodes introduce other collectibles such as alarm clocks.[7]   Alan Wake (voiced by Matthew Porretta) is a bestselling crime fiction author suffering from a two-year stretch of writer's block. He and his wife Alice travel to the small mountain town of Bright Falls, Washington for a short vacation on the advice of Alice and Alan's friend and agent Barry Wheeler. Before their arrival, Alan has a nightmare about shadowy figures who try to kill him, before an ethereal figure interrupts the dream and teaches him how to utilize the light to fend off the shadows.  Upon arrival in Bright Falls, Alan goes to retrieve the keys and map to their rented cabin from Carl Stucky, the cabin's landlord, but encounters a mysterious old woman, who tells him that Stucky had fallen ill and she was entrusted to give Alan the keys. The woman directs Alan and Alice to a cabin on an island in the middle of Cauldron Lake, a volcanic crater lake. As they unpack, Alice reveals to Alan that the real purpose of their trip is to help break his writer's block by arranging for him to see a famous Bright Falls psychologist named Dr. Emil Hartman and leaving a typewriter in one of the cabin's rooms for him to work on his next book. Alan is infuriated and storms out of the cabin, but rushes back when he hears Alice crying for help. Alan returns to the cabin just as Alice is being dragged into the lake's waters by a mysterious force. Alan dives into the water after her, blacking out as he submerges.  Alan regains consciousness a week later, apparently having driven his car off the road, but with no memory of how he got there. He attempts to reach a nearby gas station, but his progress is hampered by murderous, shadowy figures resembling those in his dream. While fighting the shadows with light, Alan repeatedly encounters an ethereal figure in a diving suit similar to the one from his dream, which leaves behind pages of a manuscript entitled Departure, ostensibly written by Alan, which he has no memory of writing. Alan soon discovers that the events of the manuscript are coming true, and that the shadowy figures, or ""Taken,"" are townsfolk possessed by a dark force. After killing a possessed Carl Stucky and reaching the gas station, Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Breaker of his wife's disappearance, but Sarah states that there has been no island or cabin in Cauldron Lake for years after it sank following a volcanic eruption years prior. Alan is taken to the police station, and Barry arrives in Bright Falls in search of him.  Alan receives a call from a man purporting to be Alice's kidnapper, demanding the pages of Departure in exchange for her. Meeting at a nearby national park, Alan witnesses the kidnapper at the mercy of the mysterious old woman, confessing that he never actually had Alice. Alan and the kidnapper are then attacked by a dark tornado, which hurls Alan into Cauldron Lake. He awakens in the lodge overlooking Cauldron Lake under the care of Hartman, who claims that Alan is suffering a psychotic break, with the supernatural phenomena being fabrications of his imagination. Alan attempts to escape the lodge as the shadowy force starts to attack it, learning in the process that the fake kidnapper was employed by Hartman to lure Alan to him. Hartman tries to stop Alan from escaping, and gives the impression that he is aware of the supernatural events surrounding the lake. Barry helps Alan to escape the lodge before the shadow subsumes it and all those inside.  Alan and Barry gradually begin to learn the truth about Cauldron Lake from the other townsfolk. An entity known as the Dark Presence (taking the form of the old woman, Barbara Jagger) is trapped within the lake, attempting to escape by using the lake's power to turn fiction into reality. It had previously tried this with a poet named Thomas Zane – the figure in the diving suit – but Zane was able to resist its will and used his writings to cause the volcanic eruption that sank the island, stranding himself within the lake. The Dark Presence has grown strong enough to start to influence the townspeople and create the forces that have pursued Alan. That night, as Alan and Barry take shelter, they get drunk on moonshine, and Alan starts to recall memories of being forced to write Departure during the prior week, realizing that the Dark Presence is now trying to use his writings to escape, and is holding Alice within the lake in order to coerce him.  Alan and Barry are arrested by an FBI agent, but the Taken assault the police station and drag the agent away. Sarah, now convinced of the Dark Presence's existence, helps Alan and Barry reach Cynthia Weaver, a hermit who knew Thomas Zane and prepared countermeasures for the Dark Presence's return. She leads them to the ""Well-Lit Room,"" containing a light switch known as the Clicker, which, through the power of Alan's writings, possesses the narrative ability to destroy the Dark Presence. Alan returns to Cauldron Lake alone and dives in, finding himself in a surreal alternate dimension known as the Dark Place, where thoughts and ideas become reality. Alan encounters Jagger and destroys her with the Clicker; realizing he must maintain balance in the story, Alan completes Departure by freeing Alice, but strands himself in the Dark Place in the process. Finishing Departure, Alan writes the final line - ""It's not a lake, it's an ocean.""[8]  "
41,Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX,/wiki/Alex_Kidd_in_Miracle_World_DX," Alex Kidd in Miracle World is a 2D platform game. The player must finish levels and overcome obstacles and puzzles in both scrolling and single-screen environments. Throughout the 17 stages, Alex faces many monsters and the three henchmen of Janken the Great, before facing Janken himself.[2]  Alex's punching ability is used to destroy enemies and to break rocks in order to access new paths and to collect items such as money which can then be used to purchase other items including vehicles such as motorbikes and helicopters.[3] At the end of many stages, Alex plays jan-ken-pon (rock-paper-scissors) with one of Janken's henchmen. Alex dies with one hit, or by losing a game of rock, paper, scissors.  The game has no save system, but by holding the directional pad up and pressing the 2 button eight times at the Game Over screen, the player will restart the level with three new lives, at a cost of 400 Baums (the in-game currency).   A young martial artist named Alex Kidd learns of a villain named Janken the Great who has defeated King Thunder of the city of Radaxian and who has kidnapped his son, Prince Egle (or 'Igul'), and Egle's fiancée Princess Lora. Discovering that he is the lost son of King Thunder, Alex sets out to rescue the kingdom. On his quest, he defeats Janken's henchmen and retrieves various items which lead him toward Janken whom he defeats and sees turned to stone. Alex retrieves the crown, and the people of Radaxian are restored under the newly crowned King Egle.[4][5][6]  "
42,Alfred Hitchcock – Vertigo,/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock_%E2%80%93_Vertigo," Alfred Hitchcock – Vertigo is an adventure game that takes place in a three-dimensional game world. The player controls three characters,[1] with a focus on solving mysteries tied to flashbacks.[2]   Vertigo tells the story of Ed Miller, a writer whose life is changed by a car wreck.[2] Although he is left mysteriously uninjured, he claims that his wife and daughter, both missing, were in the car with him.[1] Traumatized and experiencing intense vertigo, he enters therapy in an effort to learn what happened.[2]  "
44,Alien Isolation,/wiki/Alien_Isolation," Alien: Isolation is a single-player action-adventure game with an emphasis on stealth and survival horror. The player controls Amanda Ripley from a first-person perspective,[1][2] and must explore a space station and complete objectives while avoiding, outsmarting, and defeating enemies.[3] Objectives range from activating computers to collecting certain items or reaching a specific area. The player can run, climb ladders, sneak into vents, crouch behind objects to break the line of sight with enemies, and peek over or lean around for a safe view.[3] The player also has the ability to go under tables or inside empty lockers to hide from enemies.[3]  Amanda encounters various enemies throughout the station, including hostile human survivors and androids. The player can either eliminate them or avoid them using stealth or distractions.[3] The main antagonist, an Alien creature, pursues the player throughout. The Alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive.[2] Instead of following a predetermined path, the Alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound.[3] Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the Alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the Alien finding the player. For example, if the Alien is close enough, it will be attracted by the tracker's sound, forcing the player to use the tracker wisely and remove it as soon as it detects motion.[3] The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine if the alien creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.[3][4]  Although Amanda gains access to a revolver, a shotgun, a bolt gun, a flamethrower, and a stun baton over the course of the game,[5][6] Alien: Isolation emphasizes evasion over direct combat by providing limited ammunition.[2] The player can also craft useful items by collecting schematics and different materials. Items include EMP detonators, noisemakers, molotov cocktails, and pipe bombs; these can help the player deal with enemies.[5] For example, the noisemaker can be used to attract enemies in a particular direction. The Alien is afraid of fire, so using flame weapons forces it to retreat into the station's ventilation system. The player has a limited amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies; health is restored with medkits, which can be crafted with materials in Amanda's inventory.[3]  The space station is divided into sections connected by trams and elevators. Some doors require certain actions before entry is allowed; for example, some require a keycard or entry codes, while others need to be hacked or cut open with welding torches.[4] Computer terminals and rewiring stations can be used to access information and trigger actions such as disabling security cameras or manipulating the space station's air-purification mechanism. [4] Shutting off the air-purification mechanism allows for a more stagnant air quality masking Amanda's scent making it harder for the Alien to track her, at the cost of a perpetual ""Dutch oven"" of any excreted gasses. An automap helps the player navigate the different areas.[7] To save game progress, the player needs to locate a terminal and insert Amanda's access card. If Amanda dies, the player will have to restart from the last saved point.[8] In addition to the campaign mode, Alien: Isolation features a special mode, called Survivor Mode, in which the player must complete objectives within a time limit on different challenge maps while being hunted by the Alien.[9]   In 2137, 15 years after the events of the original Alien film,[2] Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley, learns that the flight recorder of her mother's ship, the Nostromo, has been located. The flight recorder was retrieved by the salvage ship Anesidora, and is being held aboard Sevastopol, a Seegson Corporation space station orbiting gas giant KG-348 in the Zeta Reticuli star system. Christopher Samuels, a Weyland-Yutani android, offers Ripley a place on the retrieval team so that she can have closure regarding the fate of her missing mother.   Ripley, Samuels, and Weyland-Yutani executive Nina Taylor travel to Sevastopol via the Torrens, a courier ship, only to find the station damaged and external communications offline. While attempting to spacewalk into Sevastopol, their EVA line is severed by debris, and Ripley is separated from the others and forced to enter the station on her own. While exploring the station, Ripley finds the flight recorder of the Nostromo, but the data has been corrupted, and also discovers that the station is out of control due to a deadly Alien creature lurking aboard. After regrouping with Samuels and Taylor, Ripley meets the station's Marshal Waits and his deputy Ricardo. Waits explains that the alien was brought onto the station by Anesidora captain Henry Marlow, who, after recovering the Nostromo's flight recorder while salvaging its remains in space,  was able to backtrack the Nostromo's path to LV-426 and locate the derelict alien starship, containing within a nest of alien eggs. While inside, Marlow's wife was attacked by a Facehugger and brought aboard Sevastopol for emergency medical treatment, but died after a Chestburster hatched from her. Waits convinces Ripley to contain the Alien inside a remote module of the station, and then eject it into space. Although Ripley is successful, Waits ejects the module with her still inside. Careening into KG-348, Ripley space-jumps back to Sevastopol using a space suit.  Ripley makes her way back to confront Waits, but Ricardo reveals that the station's service androids have abruptly started slaughtering the remaining crew, including Waits. Samuels attempts to interface with the station's artificial intelligence, APOLLO, to cease the rampage. However, the systems' defensive countermeasures kill him shortly after he opens a path for Ripley into APOLLO's control core. There, Ripley discovers that Seegson had been trying to sell off Sevastopol to Weyland-Yutani, who instructed APOLLO to protect the Alien at all costs. Ripley tells APOLLO that the creature is no longer aboard the station and demands it cease all activity, but the system refuses, stating that ""scheduled reactor scans are unverified"". At the reactor, Ripley discovers a nest with hundreds of Aliens, and initiates a reactor purge to destroy it.   Later, Ripley learns that Taylor was secretly sent to retrieve the Alien from Sevastopol, and that she freed Marlow in exchange for the location of LV-426. However, Marlow double-crosses and takes her hostage aboard the Anesidora. There, Ripley finally discovers the Nostromo's flight recorder, containing a personal message to her from her mother, thus giving her closure. Meanwhile, Marlow attempts to overload the fusion reactor of the Anesidora to destroy Sevastopol and ensure that no creatures survive; Taylor kills him in an attempt to stop this, but she herself is killed by an electric discharge, forcing Ripley to escape shortly before the Anesidora explodes. The explosion destroys Sevastopol's orbital stabilizers, causing the station to slowly drift into KG-348's atmosphere. Ripley and Ricardo contact the Torrens for extraction, but a Facehugger latches on to Ricardo, forcing Ripley to leave him. After making her way outside to help the Torrens detach from the station, Ripley is surrounded by Alien creatures and ultimately thrown into the ship by a blast. Aboard the Torrens, Ripley discovers that another Alien has boarded the ship. When she is cornered in the airlock, she ejects herself and the Alien into space. Adrift in her space suit, Ripley is awakened by a searchlight.  "
45,The Alliance Alive HD Remastered,/wiki/The_Alliance_Alive_HD_Remastered," The Alliance Alive is a role-playing video game in which the player takes control of a group eventually numbering nine characters, navigating an unnamed fantasy world in a quest to free it from the control of otherworldly beings called Daemons.[1] Players explore a world map, first on foot and later using vehicles which can unlock previously inaccessible parts of the map. During the course of the story, the party unites human-staffed Guilds scattered across the land, based in Guild Towers which are either found on the world map or can be built by the player in select locations. There are five types of Guild Towers available, which grant different status buffs to the party, with the type of Guild Tower available to build depending on which characters have been recruited into the party. Guild Towers can communicate with each other during the course of the game using the Telegraph system, which allows Towers to gain experience levels and unlock new abilities.[2][3]  Enemy characters are represented within environments and on the world map as symbols, with battles triggering when the party runs into them. Multiple enemy parties can be tagged for a series of back-to-back battles. Battles are governed by a turn-based battle system within a themed battle arena. Characters are arranged in formations on a three-by-five grid, with different formations granting unique defensive and offensive abilities. Magic is only accessible to Daemon characters, although certain weapon types can access magic-like abilities for human characters such as healing. During combat, characters can enter an ""Ignition"" state once the Ignition gauge is filled from being attacked. Entering an Ignition state, which can rise in intensity based on current skills, attack power is increased at the cost of higher skill point consumption for special abilities. When in an Ignition state, a character can launch a special ""Final Strike"" attack which deals high damage. If a character in the same class as the attacker is next to them, they will ""Reinforce"" the Final Strike, creating a longer attack chain.[4][5]  Rather than a traditional experience point-based leveling system, character skills grow more powerful through ""Awakening"" when used often enough. Completing successive battles will increase a skill's growth.[4] Characters have access to five weapon types with differing strengths and weaknesses: Swords, Great Swords, Axes, Spears, Staffs, Bows, Shields, and Martial Arts. These weapon types can be equipped to any character, and have specific Awakening skills tied to them.[3] Triggering a battle near a Guild Tower enables Telegraph abilities which aid the party in battle, such as creating a shield or dealing a powerful attack to all enemies at the beginning of a battle.[2] A separate ""Talent"" system can be raised for each character using Talent Points earned after each battle. Assigning these points to Talents will increase a character attribute such as their ability to regain health or energy, their weapon skills, and status buffs during navigation of the world map.[6]  "
46,The Alto Collection,/wiki/The_Alto_Collection," Alto's Odyssey keeps the same basic gameplay of the original, being a side-scrolling endless runner based around snowboarding (now sandboarding). The player can jump by tapping the screen and do tricks by holding down on it. By doing tricks the player can increase their score which gets added to an online leaderboard at the end of their run. The sequel is set in a desert which features three ""biomes"" you can unlock that each focus on different mechanics.  In the beginning of the game, the player starts in the dunes, which features rolling hills and rocks for the player to avoid. Another biome is the canyons, which highlights the new wall riding mechanic, allowing the player to climb up the side of canyon walls by holding down on the screen. The final biome is the temples, which has vines which the player can ride on and waterfalls that can speed up the character. Later in the game it is possible to unlock a compass which allows the player to travel between biomes for a fixed cost in coins.[1]  The game adds new features, such as wall-riding, water mechanics, tornadoes, falling platforms, a new power up, and balloon bouncing; and mechanics returning from the first installment such as a day-night cycle, weather, and the wingsuit.[2][3] Like its predecessor, in addition to its original game mode, it also has a Zen mode, in which the player is invulnerable and can get up after hitting obstacles.  The game also retains the challenge system of the first game, where completing challenges allows the player to level up and unlock new characters. In Odyssey's ""Workshop"", the player can spend coins they collected in order to upgrade power-ups or unlock new abilities and features.[4]  "
48,Amnesia Collection,/wiki/Amnesia_Collection," Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a first-person adventure game with survival horror elements. The player takes control of Daniel, who must navigate Castle Brennenburg  while avoiding various dangers and solving puzzles. The gameplay retains the physical object interaction used in the Penumbra series, allowing for physics-based puzzles and interactions such as opening doors and fixing machinery.[3] Smaller items can be stored in an inventory menu, while larger objects can be raised by holding down a mouse button and pushing or pulling the mouse. Objects such as doors or levers can be manipulated by using the mouse in a fashion that imitates moving the said object. The game's difficulty level can be adjusted preceding its initiation, but cannot be readjusted once the game has begun.  In addition to a health indicator, Daniel's sanity must be managed, centered around an ""afraid of darkness"" mechanic. According to designer Thomas Grip, ""the idea was basically that the darkness itself should be an enemy.""[11] Sanity is reduced by staying in the dark for too long, witnessing unsettling events or looking directly at monsters. Low sanity causes visual and auditory hallucinations and an increased chance of attracting monsters, while its complete depletion results in a temporary drop in mobility, or death in higher difficulties. Light sources help restore sanity, and if none are available, Daniel may use tinderboxes to ignite candles and torches or deploy an oil-burning lantern. However, the number of tinderboxes and the amount of oil available are both limited, even more so in higher difficulties.  If a monster sees Daniel, it will chase him until he evades its sight. Daniel has no means of fighting monsters, so he must either avoid being seen or run away. Daniel can withstand only a few attacks from a monster before he dies, which will cause the most recent save of the game to load. The player can restore Daniel's health by using laudanum found throughout the game. The player can hinder monsters by closing doors and building barricades from nearby objects. However, monsters can destroy doors and knock over objects. Hiding in dark areas where monsters will not notice Daniel is also effective, but will decrease Daniel's sanity. In higher difficulties, the monsters will move faster, deal more damage and search for Daniel for longer periods of time.   On 19 August 1839, a young man awakens in the dark and empty halls of the Prussian Brennenburg Castle with no memory about himself or his past.[2] All he can remember is that his name is Daniel, that he lives in Mayfair, and that something or someone is hunting him.[12][13] Shortly after regaining consciousness, Daniel finds a note he wrote to himself, which informs him that he has deliberately erased his own memory and is being hunted by a ""Shadow"", an unearthly presence that manifests itself through fleshy, acidic growths spreading throughout the castle. The note instructs Daniel to descend into the Inner Sanctum of the castle in order to find and kill its baron, Alexander.  As he makes his way through the castle, Daniel gradually learns both about its mysteries and about his own past, through notes and diaries he finds as well as through sudden flashbacks and visions. The origin of his situation is a mysterious orb that he recovered from the Tin Hinan Tomb, which unleashed the Shadow. Each of the experts he contacted and consulted in person about the orb was later found gruesomely dismembered. Realizing that the Shadow was slowly stalking him, Daniel desperately exhausted all archaeological leads into strange orbs until contacted by Alexander, who promised a means of repelling the threat of the Shadow via a ""vitae"" energy, which could only be harvested from living creatures via extreme pain and terror. However, Alexander's true purpose is to use Daniel's vitae-enriched orb to return to his native dimension, from which he was banished centuries prior. To achieve this end, Alexander and Daniel gathered vitae by torturing innocent people that Alexander claimed to be murderous criminals.  To maximize the production of vitae, the victims were forced to consume a potion that induced amnesia, so that they could never grow accustomed to their torment. Unbeknownst to Daniel, application of vitae to the orb further enraged the Shadow in addition to briefly repelling it, sealing his eventual doom. Increasingly desperate to escape the Shadow, Daniel became sadistic in his attempts to harvest vitae, and accidentally killed an escaping prisoner, a young girl, in a fit of rage. Following the final ritual, Alexander sensed Daniel's guilt and declining faith in him and left him for dead as a result. Realizing how Alexander had manipulated him, Daniel swore revenge and swallowed an amnesia potion in order to overcome his paralyzing guilt.  As Daniel nears the Inner Sanctum, he encounters Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, a man who had once studied the orbs with his student Johann Weyer and has since been kept alive and imprisoned by Alexander. He tells Daniel that Weyer has been able to harness the power of the orbs to travel between dimensions, and instructs him in finding the pieces of what used to be his own orb, which is needed to breach the Inner Sanctum. Agrippa also asks Daniel to take with him his head, which can be severed alive using a tonic invented by Weyer, and throw it into the inter-dimensional portal after Alexander opens it. Once Daniel enters the Inner Sanctum, there are three possible endings: he can let Alexander succeed, then be killed by the Shadow and descend into darkness, while Alexander tells him his sacrifice will be forever celebrated; he can prevent the portal from opening by knocking over its support columns, then leave the castle content with his redemption after the Shadow kills only Alexander; or he can throw Agrippa's head into the portal, which leaves the Shadow to kill both Alexander and Daniel, though Agrippa promises to save Daniel from descending into darkness, calling upon Weyer to help him.  "
50,Among Us,/wiki/Among_Us," Among Us is a multiplayer game for four to fifteen players (previously four to ten players), although recommended for at least five.[13] Up to three players are randomly[14] and secretly chosen to be the Impostor(s) each round. As of 2021, a round can take place on one of four maps: a spaceship called ""The Skeld""; a headquarters building called ""MIRA HQ""; a planet base called ""Polus"";[15] or an airship based on Innersloth's Henry Stickmin series called ""The Airship"".[16][17]  The Crewmates can win the game one of two ways; either by completing all assigned tasks or by ejecting all Impostors. Impostors can likewise win in two ways; either by killing or ejecting all Crewmates,[e] or by sabotaging a critical system on the map (provided the Crewmates do not resolve it in time).[15] Games can also end by players quitting the match if doing so fulfills any win condition (if a Crewmate quits the game, their tasks are automatically considered completed).[18][19][20]  At the start of the game, Crewmates are assigned ""tasks"" to complete around the map (in the form of minigames, minipuzzles, and simple toggles), mostly consisting of maintenance work on vital systems such as fixing wires and downloading data.[21] Impostors are given a fake list of suggested tasks to blend in with Crewmates. However, they cannot legitimately perform tasks and can only pretend to be doing any of the tasks on the ship. Impostors, however, can sabotage vital systems (such as The Skeld's oxygen supply), close the doors to rooms, quickly and covertly traverse ventilation ducts (commonly referred to as ""venting""), and kill Crewmates when standing near them. To help the Crewmates identify Impostors, there are various surveillance systems on each map, such as security cameras and an admin system on The Skeld,[22] a doorlog system with sensors in MIRA HQ,[23] and a vitals indicator in Polus that shows the living status of all players.[15] Crewmates may also confirm their identity through ""visual tasks"" (tasks that have animations which play for other players), which cannot be faked by Impostors.[24]  If a Crewmate is killed or any player is voted out and ejected, they become a ghost. Ghosts can pass through walls, watch other players' activities, and see and chat with other ghosts.[20] Living players have a limited cone of vision;[25] ghosts do not.[26] Moreover, ghosts cannot communicate with living players or be seen by them. Ghosts help their living teammates by completing their tasks (as a Crewmate) or performing various acts of sabotage (as an Impostor).[15]  Any living player may call a group meeting by reporting a dead body, or by pressing the Emergency Meeting button on the map at any time (except during major sabotages, when Emergency Meetings cannot be called, but dead bodies can still be reported).[20][27][28] During a meeting, players discuss who they believe is an Impostor based on the available evidence. Impostors can be identified beyond all reasonable doubt if they are seen venting or killing. A player may be suspected for many other reasons though. However, all the players form a sort of jury and must weigh the veracity or value of each other's statements and questions during the meeting. A plurality vote is held, and if a plurality is obtained, the player whom the most crewmates voted is ejected from the map and they become a ghost, unless the majority of the crewmates choose to skip vote or there is a tie vote.[21][20] Players can communicate in a built-in text chat (with some predefined phrases for phone users),[21] but only during meetings, and only if they are alive (though ghosts can speak with one another at any time).[15][20][25] While the game does not have a built-in voice chat system, it is common for players to use external programs such as Discord,[29][30][31] or to converse regularly if they are in close physical proximity to one another. In case players can hear each other's voices, the game reminds them to not speak except during meetings.  In November 2021, additional roles were made available to players extending beyond the standard Crewmate or Impostor roles. Crewmates can also be Engineers, Scientists, or Guardian Angels. Engineers can travel through vents like Impostors can, albeit to a limited capacity. Scientists can check vitals at any time to see if any player has been killed recently. Crewmates who become Ghosts can become Guardian Angels, which can temporarily protect living players from being killed. Impostors likewise can be Shapeshifters, allowing them to temporarily morph into other players.   In each game's lobby, various options can be adjusted to customize aspects of gameplay, such as player movement speed, the allowed number of emergency meetings, number of tasks, if there will be ""visual tasks"",[32] or whether or not an Impostor is revealed after being voted off.[33] There are also many cosmetic options, including spacesuit colors, skins, hats, and pets,[34][35] some of which are paid downloadable content.[f][5][7][25]  "
51,Ancestors Legacy,/wiki/Ancestors_Legacy," Ancestor's Legacy offers two game modes: a single-player campaign scenario or a multiplayer game, in which the player can choose to play one of four civilizations: Vikings, Anglo-Saxons, Teutons, or Slavs[3] (the Saladin's Conquest DLC adds a fifth civilization, the Saracens). The game features a day/night cycle which changes the way factions play.  "
52,Angels of Death,/wiki/Angels_of_Death_(video_game)," 13-year-old Rachel ""Ray"" Gardner is taken to a hospital for counseling after witnessing murder. However she wakes up to find herself on the basement Floor B7 instead with no memories apart from her name and the reason she came to the hospital. A series of mysterious broadcasts and scribbled messages on the wall set the scene as a game where each participant is designated a floor of their own, and anyone who trespasses on another participant's floor has the chance to be killed. Ray, ignorant of the details, is almost killed by serial killer Isaac ""Zack"" Foster, the owner of Floor B6, and captured by Daniel ""Danny"" Dickens, the owner of Floor B5 and the doctor who examined her. Danny, who has a maniacal obsession with eyes, desires Rachel's blue, once-blank eyes. During this time, Ray recovers her memory during the night when the murder occurred, just as Zack kills Danny for her, but spares Ray after losing interest in her lack of emotions. As Zack has killed someone that was not on his floor, the broadcast designates him as a ""sacrifice"" along with Ray, where they can freely be killed by any floor master. The two, now in the same situation, form an alliance where Zack can use her intelligence to escape, and upon doing so will fulfill Ray's desire to be killed by him.  Ray and Zack continue to go to the upper floors to find a way out, defeating the two other floor masters, Edward ""Eddie"" Mason at B4, a young boy with an unhealthy obsession with graves, and Catherine ""Cathy"" Ward at B3, a sadomasochistic former jail guard, in the process. When Zack gets injured during the fight against Cathy, Ray encounters a reverend, Abraham Gray, at B2 who reveals himself to be the one who designed the game in order to figure out the definition of ""religious faith"" in people's hearts, appointing the various floor masters as ""angels"" that are not afraid to kill without hesitation. Although Gray lets Ray return to B5 to get medicine, she must pass through a trial to determine her identity before she can proceed to the next floor. Meanwhile, back on B2, Zack discovers that Danny is still alive, the latter having faked his death. Ray is forced to confront her selfishness in the trial but survives through it to save Zack, convincing herself that he is her God.  When the duo arrives at B1 though, they come to a house filled with fake flowers and the stitched corpses of a couple, driving Ray hysterical and desperate for Zack to kill her immediately. Danny then tricks Zack into leaving Ray alone in the room and locking it up, forcing Zack to search the floor in order to discover the truth about Ray. With help from Gray, Zack discovers that Ray suffered in the midst of her parents' terrible relationship, and subsequently both were killed, with her father killing her mother, and Ray shooting her father. After this, she stitched their corpses together to form her new ""perfect family"". While counseling her at the hospital, Danny took an interest in her blank blue eyes and used his authority as an ""angel"" to bring her to B1, making her the final floor master. However, after discovering a bible, Ray suddenly found herself unable to cope with the realization and guilt of what she had done, believing that no one would accept her after what she did, so she developed suicidal ideations and erased her memory, causing Danny to send her to B7 with the hopes that she would return to her ""original self"". As Zack finds out the truth, Ray, coming to the realization that Zack won't become the God she desires, shoots Danny and attempts to kill Zack by leading him around the traps of her floor, but he helps her to come to terms with her actions and both renew their oath.  Just as they reach the exit, Danny activates the self-destruct sequence of the building and critically shoots Ray. However, before he can kill Ray and Zack, Gray, having completed his experiment, appears and kills Danny, allowing Zack and Ray to escape just as the building burns down. The police then promptly arrive and Zack lets himself be arrested to save Ray's life as paramedics took her away. After recovering, Ray is taken to a Rehabilitation Center due to her apparent delirium and attachment to Zack. An unspecified amount of time has passed, presumably weeks to a few months after the incident, Zack is sentenced to death.  One night, as Ray prepares to spend the night without sleeping, however, Zack somehow escaped prison and breach the Rehabilitation Center to pick up Ray. Realizing that Zack is still intent on keeping the promise between them, Ray once again implores Zack to kill her as they escape. By the time Ray's caretaker and the police break through the door, Ray and Zack have disappeared, leaving only Zack's knife behind beneath the windowsill.  "
55,Animal Crossing New Horizons,/wiki/Animal_Crossing_New_Horizons," As in previous Animal Crossing games, New Horizons is a life simulation game played in real time. Weather also adjusts to the seasons of the Northern or Southern Hemisphere, depending on the player's real-world location, a first for the Animal Crossing series.[1][2] The game follows a villager customized by the player,[3] who, after purchasing a getaway package from Tom Nook, moves into a deserted island.[4] After Tom Nook gives the player essentials, such as a tent, the game proceeds in a non-linear fashion, allowing for the player to play the game as they choose.[5]  The player is given open access to natural resources such as fruit and wood, which can be collected and crafted into a variety of items and furniture known as D.I.Y. crafting. Alongside this, they can catch bugs and fish,[6][7][8] plant and grow trees and flowers,[9] extract natural resources such as rocks,[10] and swim in the ocean.[11] The island gives open space for placing items and decorating as the player chooses.[12] Certain content available, such as organisms, are season-dependant and only appear for a limited time of the year. Doing simple tasks rewards the player with ""Nook Miles"", which in return can purchase premium rewards in Resident Services. The other currency ""Bells"", a staple in the Animal Crossing franchise, can be used to purchase other goods and services. Another feature offered early on is the ""Dodo Airlines"", an airport; through Dodo Airlines, and tickets purchased through Nook Miles, the player can visit other vacant islands to harvest resources, and meet other villagers.[13] The player can invite other villagers they meet to their island if they choose.[14]  The player starts with two other random anthropomorphic villagers that also purchase the getaway package; these villagers will live alongside the player and can be interacted with, building relationships.[15] When the player has made sufficient progress in the game, Tom Nook gives more freedom of expanding as a village. Other shopowners will visit and settle on the island; museum-owner Blathers, who will display fish, bugs, sea creatures, fossils, and art captured by the player; sisters Mabel and Sable, who sell clothing and other player-created accessories;[16][17] and Timmy and Tommy, who run a store that specializes in selling furniture and other quality-of-life items,[18] eventually expanding to sell more items per day.[15] Eventually, the main area will expand to a Town Hall, run by Tom Nook with the help of Isabelle;[5] other buildings and villagers will populate the community, and old tents and shops will grow into a more permanent structure that can still be moved if the player chooses. From there, the island will be given a star rating out of five, usually starting off at a one-star rating. As the island is further developed, the island's star rating will increase. When a three-star rating is achieved, K.K. Slider, a popular musician, will visit and perform a concert at the island, marking the ""end"" of the game as the credits roll.[19] However, more options for island customization are given to the player for further community growth, such as the ability to construct and destroy cliffs, bodies of water and paths, colloquially referred to as terraforming.[20][21]  The game supports one island per Switch system.[22] Animal Crossing: New Horizons supports both local and online co-op gameplay, with up to four players locally and eight players online able to occupy an island at any given time, an option available through the Dodo Airlines.[23] The game supports amiibo cards and figures from the Animal Crossing series, which can be used to invite a villager to the island temporarily that can be convinced to join the island. Nintendo Switch Online cloud saving was added during a late July 2020 update, allowing users to recover game data if their Switch is broken or lost.[24] Additional free content was added every few months, added on every update by downloading the latest update from Nintendo, but major updates ceased with the release of the version 2.0 update on November 3, 2021.[25]  "
56,Anodyne,/wiki/Anodyne_(video_game)," Anodyne is played by exploring a dream world of the game's protagonist, Young. The gameplay involves the use of two primary items, a broom and shoes for jumping. The game takes place in adjacent screen-sized rooms that make up the game's play areas. The player explores dungeons, which are sets of rooms with puzzles and enemies, as well as other areas that focus less on combat and puzzles, such as a red, swamp-like area, and a dimly-lit forest. The player is required to find a certain number of cards in order to progress to the end sections of the game.  "
58,Anonymous;Code,/wiki/Anonymous;Code," In the year 2036, the Sad Morning disaster occurs, where an incident involving computers leads to the destruction of major cities around the world. A similar event is expected to take place in 2038, so a supercomputer called GAIA is used to create an alternate Earth using an Earth Simulator in order to study the possible effects of the impending catastrophe. The experiment was initially inconclusive because of the possibility of low birth rates in the alternate Earth, so a message called the Arecibo Message was used to allow humans to live there. However, humanity in the alternate Earth then creates their own Earth Simulator which leads to questions about the original Earth's existence. The game takes place in 2037. The protagonist, a hacker named Pollon Takaoka, has an ability which allows him to save and load moments, much like save features in video games.[1]  "
60,Another World,/wiki/Another_World_(video_game)," Another World is a platform game, featuring a control scheme where the player uses either the keyboard, joystick or gamepad to make the protagonist run, jump, attack and perform other, situation-specific actions, such as rocking a cage back and forth. In the initial part of the game, the player's character Lester is unarmed. He is able to kick at small creatures, but is otherwise defenseless.  Later in the game, the player acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a standard fire mode, the ability to create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls.[7] Enemies also have the same capabilities, requiring the player to take advantage of the three gun modes and the environment to overcome them.  Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and the game ends immediately if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard.[8] However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. In any given scene, the game provides no clues as to what the player should do next, features no HUD except for an oxygen bar during the swimming sequences, and no on-screen text; and the characters the player meets speak in an unintelligible alien language.[9][10]   The protagonist of the game is Lester Knight Chaykin, a young physicist. In the opening cinematic, Lester arrives at his high-tech underground laboratory in his Ferrari 288 GTO[11] during a thunderstorm and goes to work on his experiment using a particle accelerator, attempting to reconstruct what happened when the universe was born. Immediately before the particles reach their intended destination, a lightning bolt strikes the laboratory and interferes with the accelerator, causing an unforeseen particle fusion and an explosion, opening a hole in time and space and teleporting Lester to a barren, alien planet.[9]  After evading a number of dangerous indigenous animals, Lester is captured by a race of humanoid aliens and taken to a subterranean prison camp. Lester escapes along with an alien captive known as ""Buddy"" and the two must evade capture while travelling through a series of dangerous environments, battling alien soldiers and wild creatures while solving numerous puzzles in order to survive. The duo traverse the prison complex, a cave system and a tower structure.[9][10] In the game's climax, Lester is severely wounded by one of the aliens, but with the help of his alien friend, manages to kill his attacker and escape. After reaching the top of the tower, Lester collapses, but is promptly joined by Buddy, who picks Lester up and the two escape on a dragon-like creature, flying off to the horizon.  "
61,AO Tennis 2,/wiki/AO_Tennis_2," AO Tennis 2 game features multiple types of tennis match.[1] The re-designed career mode features a new managing system. Players have to earn money and experience that can be used to boost players' skills and stats. The higher level is, the better form would like to perform.[2] While performance on court is important, how to deal with press conference, how to maintain good relationship with your team would also be critical for players' reputations and decide the quality of sponsors that players can pick up.[3]  In addition to the solo game, the game introduces a multiplayer mode which offers up to four local players competing head-to-head. A cooperation mode is also available so that players can team up in doubles online.[4] Like its predecessor AO Tennis, all custom players and venues sharing with the community are downloadable for the game.[5]  "
63,Ape Out,/wiki/Ape_Out," Ape Out is a single player beat 'em up video game played from a top-down perspective.[1][2] The player controls a gorilla running through a maze while evading enemies in the form of gun-wielding humans. The human enemies are easily killed with a single attack and can also be grabbed and used as a shield; however, as they are armed with guns, they can quickly kill the player as well. The principal aim of the game is to escape each level and killing enemies is not technically required in order to proceed.[3]  The maze design is randomized and is slightly different on each play, making it impossible to memorize the layout of a level.[4]  One of the game's main themes is jazz music and each of the game's four chapters are represented as jazz albums with each level representing one track.[5] The gameplay features a loud and chaotic, all-percussion jazz soundtrack composed by Matt Boch (associate arts professor at NYU Game Center)[6] which reacts dynamically to the gameplay, for example by increasing in intensity as the player faces more enemies, crashing cymbals each time an enemy is killed and adjusting the volume according to one's speed and number of kills.[7]  In order to provide a reactive and procedurally generated soundtrack for each playthrough, the game draws from a bank of thousands of recorded individual drum sounds, some recorded by Boch with others sourced externally, and combines them according to player movement. The system will also match the location of what is happening on screen to the drum or cymbal which matches that approximate location on a real drum kit. Each chapter of the game also features a different style of jazz percussion, with Boch describing the first chapter as the most quintessentially jazz, whereas other chapters feature more unusual instruments for jazz music.[6][7] The end of the last chapter features the song ""You've Got to Have Freedom"" by Pharoah Sanders.[5]  The game also features a minimalist art style which has been compared to that of Saul Bass.[8][5][9]  "
64,Apex Legends,/wiki/Apex_Legends," Apex Legends is an online multiplayer battle royale game featuring squads of three players using pre-made characters with distinctive abilities, called ""Legends"", similar to those of hero shooters.[1] Alternate modes have been introduced allowing for single and for two-player squads since the game's release.[2][3] The game is free-to-play and monetized through microtransactions and loot boxes, which allow the player to spend both real money and in-game currency on cosmetic items, such as outfits for the Legends and new colors for weapons.[4][5]  Each match generally features twenty teams of three-player squads. Players can join friends in a squad or can be matched randomly with other players. Before the match, each player on the squad selects one of the 21 playable characters (as of season 13), with the exception that no character may be selected more than once by a squad. Each character in the squad has a unique design, personality, and abilities that provide different playstyles to the team. All teams are then placed on an aircraft that passes over the game map. One player in each squad is the jumpmaster, selecting when the squad should skydive out of the aircraft and where to land with the concurrence of the other squad members. However, players are free to deviate from the squad's path.  Once on the ground, the squad can scavenge for weapons, armor, and other equipment that is scattered around buildings, or in crates randomly distributed around the map, while keeping an eye out for other squads. Apex Legends includes a nonverbal communication ""ping system"" which allows players to use their game controller to communicate to their squad certain directions, weapon locations, enemies, and suggested strategies.[6] While the game offers movement options similar to other shooters, it includes some of the gameplay features of previous Titanfall games, such as the ability to climb over short walls, slide down inclined surfaces, and use zip-lines to traverse an area quickly.[7]  Over time, the game's safe zone will reduce in size around a randomly-selected point on the map; players outside the safe zone take damage and may die if they do not reach the safe zone in time. This also confines squads to smaller spaces to force encounters. The last squad with any members left alive is crowned the ""Apex Champions"" of that match. Players who become knocked down in the course of a game can be revived by their squadmates. Should a player be killed completely, they can still be resurrected if their team member(s) collect their respawn banner, which appears at the place where they died, and bring it to one of several beacons on the island. The banner, however, must be collected within a time limit, before expiring and fully eliminating the player.[1]  Season 9 introduced a new permanent mode named ""Arena"". In this mode, players form into three-player squads and fight against another squad in a 3v3 team deathmatch over a series of rounds to determine the winner of the match. Teams win when their team has at least 3 points and is 2 points ahead. Additionally, if a game should drag on to round 9 (where both teams have 4 points) a final sudden death round begins. Respawn stated this scoring system ""prevents total blowout games from dragging on for too long"" and also ""lets more competitive games keep the heat going for longer"".[8] Rather than skydiving onto the map and gathering equipment like in the battle royale mode, players spawn in a ""shop"" where they can purchase equipment and charges of their Legend's abilities using materials earned in the previous rounds to prepare for the next fight. This variation of the game borrows mechanics from other shooters such as Counter Strike and Valorant.[9] The mode is the first permanent deviation away from the battle royale format.  "
68,Arena of Valor,/wiki/Arena_of_Valor," Arena of Valor is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed for mobile. The overall gameplay of Arena of Valor highly resembles League of Legends, a MOBA game on PC developed and published by Riot Games, which is also a subsidiary of Tencent and sister company to TiMi.[7]  Players control characters, referred to as heroes, and each of these heroes have a unique set of abilities.[8] Heroes start the game at a low level, and can earn gold and experience (XP) in various ways: Killing non-player creatures such as minions or monsters, defeating other players, destroying structures, passively through time and through special items that can be purchased through the shop. Earning experience unlocks and augments abilities, making the hero more powerful. Items purchased in the shop do not carry over matches, and therefore all players are on equal footing at the start of every match.  Matches give players rewards, such as gold, which can then be used to buy a variety of heroes or arcana.[9] In addition to this, players can play a 'Ranked' match type, which allows them to be matched with players who are at their skill level and be assessed through in-game 'ranks'.[10] Stars are earned for a victory, and lost when the player loses.  "
70,Armello,/wiki/Armello," Armello is a digital simulation of a traditional fantasy tabletop role-playing game utilizing virtual dice and cards which allow the player to carry out specific actions. Up to four players assume the role of a Hero character that represents a specific animal clan, each with their own unique strengths, with the ultimate goal to storm the castle and become the new king or queen of the kingdom. The playing board area is divided into hexagon-shaped tiles that contain randomly generated[5] features such as dungeons to explore, quests to complete, rival heroes to battle, or settlements to capture.[3] As the game progresses, players can acquire currency to purchase additional abilities for their hero using a talent tree system specific to each character.  The game uses a turn-based system where players are allowed to perform actions such as equip items and purchase talents during another player's turn to reduce downtime.[3] Cards and dice are used to directly interact with the game world, and form the basis for the game's combat system. Players use cards they draw from a deck to cast spells, recruit followers, heal wounds, or use items that grant special abilities. Cards may also be played as ""Perils"" which can be laid on specific tiles to act as traps for other heroes or used immediately in combat, and other cards may be used to forge temporary alliances. Armello also features a day/night cycle where certain heroes gain advantages based on the time of day, and certain groups of enemies only appear in either the darkness or light.[3]  There are four alternative paths to victory and every hero is best suited for reaching a particular one, but every victory condition can be reached with every hero.  and characters  The game takes place in the ""dark fairy tale"" Kingdom of Armello, a world filled with anthropomorphic animals separated into numerous clans.[6] When the current king becomes corrupted by a dark force called the Rot, representatives from these factions rise up to embark on a journey to become the new king or queen in his stead.[3] Although players can, in theory, immediately attack the King, they generally have better chances if they first undertake some quests, which involve travelling around the board and are each associated with a short narrative.  The base game includes 8 playable heroes, divided into 4 clans; Thane and River (wolf), Amber and Barnaby (rabbit), Mercurio and Zosha (rat), and Sana and Brun (bear). Additional heroes, including two more clans, were added in paid DLC expansions. A fully expanded game has 24 playable characters.  "
71,Arms,/wiki/Arms_(video_game)," Arms is a 3D fighting sports game in which up to four players can control one of a variety of fighters, with the player able to perform basic fighting actions using extendable arms such as punching, throwing, blocking and dodging.[1][2] Arms features fifteen playable fighters, including Min Min and Twintelle, with five of them being released as downloadable content.[3] Each fighter starts with three unique Arms that can be selected in battle, but the use of all other fighters' Arms can be unlocked in the Get Arms mode. All fighters also have unique attributes in combat.[4] When the attack meter is fully charged, players are able to unleash a high-damage ""rush attack"" against their opponents. Players can also charge their attacks to temporarily increase damage and utilize elemental effects.[5] Each character has a different set of abilities and unique Arms for different strategies. Players are able to use the system's Joy-Con motion controls or standard button inputs with controllers such as the Pro Controller to operate each Arm individually. Players are also able to customize their Arm load outs, with each Arm being able to be selected independently. Every Arm is different with elemental attributes and varying weights that affect gameplay. Up to four players are able to play in a single match, either in a three or four-way free-for-all, or in a two-on-two mode in which teammates are tethered together.[6][7]  Besides the standard fighting mode, Arms features multiple other modes: Versus, Grand Prix, and a variety of Battle modes. In Grand Prix, players take on a set of 10 matches against computer-controlled fighters to win the championship belt.

72,Ar Nosurge DX,/wiki/Ar_Nosurge_DX," The game plays as a JRPG with visual novel segments.[1] On the role-playing side, the game does not have a traditional party setup,[2] but rather, the game alternates between two sets of characters; Delta and Cass on one side, and Ion and Earthes on the other.[1] In the regular game field, the game plays as most JRPGs do; the player maneuver's the character through the game environment, exploring small areas to find non-player characters to interact with or items to collect to aid them through progressing the game.[3] In certain areas, a bar is present in the corner of the screen.[4] The bar indicates that random battles may occur in that area, and indicate how increasingly likely they are to occur as movement transpires on the map.[4][5] Optional small talk between characters arises as the game world is explored as well.[6]  The game employs a turn based battle system with timed button press elements that amplify effectiveness. Only two characters participate in a battle at the time - Delta or Earthes as the attacker/defender, and Cass or Ion who stands back to charge their ""Song Magic"" special move.[4]  Multiple waves of enemies approach the player, which the player takes on each wave one at a time as each is defeated, with each wave placing characters on a 3x3 grid.[2][7] The player has a selection of different types of regular attacks, with varying strengths, weaknesses, and area of effects, as well as the option of using consumable items or special ""Friend Skills"" earned through game progression that award various effects.[2][8] The better the player strings together attacks, the faster the Song Magic's meter grows, which increases its attack power.[2] Attacks phases can be extended if enemies are hit with a ""break"" status incurred by good fighting, though attack number are finite, and once they are used up, the attack phase ends.[7][2] The battle transitions to the enemy phase, where the player must defends through time button presses to reduce damage aimed at Cass or Ion.[3] Battles continue until one of four scenarios occur - the player defeats all enemies, the enemies deplete all health points of the Cass or Ion, both sides run out of turns, or if the player choses to use the Song Magic attack.[8] The more the Song Magic is charged, the more powerful it is, and the more it works towards eliminating random battles from the area.[3] If the Song Magic meter is maxed out, the battle is automatically won, and random battles are eliminated from the area for the duration of the time spent there.[2][7][3]  The rest of the game's gameplay modes more closely resemble a visual novel, largely revolving around reading text and choosing from dialogue trees or other text-based options.[4][8] The ""Genometrics"" segments are story segments where the player dives into a character's subconscious dream world to help them through various mental hang-ups they're suffering through in the game.[8][4][9] The segments are split into 10-20 points on a map to be selected; each one revealing more of the narrative. Selecting each one costs Dive Points (DP), which are earned through participating in the game's battle system.[4] Certain dialogue options cost DP as well, and may hinder or help progression. If the player cannot pay the given cost of DP required, progress is halted, and the player returns to the main game. The segment is completed once enough DP is spent to read all text to the story's conclusion, and completion rewards the player with new ""Song Magic"" to be used in the game's battle system.[4][5][10] The game's ""Purification"" segments involve two characters meditating and reflecting together on various events that had transpired in the main game.[4] The player is also given the option to equip ""Genometrica Crystals"" that are obtained through progression of the Genometrics segments, which give stat boosts for the game's battle system.[4] The game also contains an item synthesis system similar to the Atelier video game series.[9] Upon traveling to item shops, and talking to their respective shop keeper synthesis recipes are obtained.[10] If the player has obtained the required items through game progression, they may combine them into new items.[10] Each item creation contains a story scene about the respective item, and can be used in further synthesizing, or for added effects in battle.[11][6]  "

75,The Artful Escape,/wiki/The_Artful_Escape," The fictional town of Calypso, Colorado is the birthplace of the deceased folk-music legend, Johnson Vendetti. On the 20th anniversary of his groundbreaking album during the 1970s, the town is holding a large festival, and Johnson's nephew, Francis Vendetti (Michael Johnston), is expected to play Johnson's folk songs at a concert. However, Francis struggles with living in the shadow of his uncle and follow folk music when he really wants to play rock music.[3][4] The day before the concert, he meets an odd woman, Violetta (Caroline Kinley), who dares him to take risks, such as climbing a tree he had been scared of climbing before. She tells Francis to look for Lightman's before she heads off, despite Francis not knowing of any such place in Calypso.  That night, Francis is visited by an alien Zomm (Jason Schwartzman) who tells him he must meet Lightman. Recalling Violetta's words, he follows Zomm to find Lightman (Carl Weathers), a guitarist that says he needs Francis to play as his opening act. Francis follows Lightman and Zomm through an impossible space below Calypso and finds himself in the Cosmic Extraordinary as they head towards the Cosmic Lung, Lightman's ship. Once there, Lightman explains that to travel through the Cosmic Extraordinary, they need to put on a show for the Glamourgonn (Courtenay Taylor) to gain clearance for the next station, which will be the only way Francis will be able to get back to Calypso in time for the concert. Francis discovers Violetta works as the head of Lightman's laser show but has reservations for Lightman's plans for Francis.  For Francis to be able to perform as Lightman's opening act, he first must travel to meet Stargordon (Mark Strong), a talent agent. There, Stargordon helps Francis conceive of a new name and identity to help sell himself, though senses that the weight of Johnson's influence still haunts Francis' life. With this identity, Francis performs for the Heliotromm, who is impressed with his performance and offers to broadcast it across the galaxy, but Francis declines, still fearing drawing attention to himself. Lightman then sends Francis to the planet of Glimmerdimm to play at a highly exclusive nightclub, but after his performance, Francis finds the only way back is to locate the warp turtle, held in fashion-strict Glimmer City. An alien, Frida, helps Francis to create a new outfit purposely to cause a ruckus in Glimmer City and reach the turtle.  Back at the Cosmic Organ, Francis learns that Lightman is no longer captain of the ship but instead Francis has been promoted due to his performances. Feeling guilty, Francis offers Lightman to be his opening act but allows Lightman to select the stage. Lightman heads to the Hyperion Wailzone, where the Glamourgonn lives. Violetta tells Francis that Lightman was the only person to have performed and survived the Glamourgonn twenty years ago and may be trying to recapture his glory. Francis follows and eventually meets with the Glamourgonn's agent, the Tastemaker (Lena Headey), to arrange to see the Glamourgonn. She sees that Francis still has doubts about accepting this new identity and reveals that when Lightman had faced him, he had brought Johnson Vendetti along, who himself had disliked the folk music he wrote about. Because Francis is still in doubt, she denies both from seeing the Glamourgonn. Francis comes to an epiphany and comes to fully accept his new persona, and demonstrates this to the Tastemaker. She sees Francis has changed, and allows him to perform for the Glamourgonn. Francis's performance, aided by Violetta's laser show, impresses the Glamourgonn, and she grants passage for the Cosmic Lung as well as providing them with a separate vehicle.  Violetta returns Francis back to Calypso, well after the concert was to go on, and promises that she will come back to see him some day. Francis goes to perform at the planned after-party event, showcasing his rock styling and new persona and stunning the crowd.[3][4]   The Artful Escape is a platform game, where the player controls Francis in moving him across a musical-infused landscape. Besides running and jumping, Francis has a guitar which he can play to create various effects, such as interacting with the scenery or facing boss characters.[5]  "

77,Ashen,/wiki/Ashen_(2018_video_game)," The game is set in a sunless world and tells the story of a character seeking a home. is described as including open-world exploration, co-operation or competition with other players, and combat with in-world monsters.[2] The game is presented in a third-person view, with a muted cel-shaded graphics presentation.[3]  The game follows the Dark Souls-style mechanics and combat. Both combat and exploration in an open world were key design elements of the game. Multiplayer elements include interactions with other players, which are incorporated into the game as providing traditional RPG elements such as crafting.[4] Combat includes ranged and melee weapons.[5]  Character growth is primarily dominated by equipment, rather than player 'stats';[6] ""Talismans"", either found or crafted, are used to upgrade character abilities or provide other in-game perks.[7]  "
79,Assassin's Creed III Remastered,/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_III_Remastered," Assassin's Creed III is an action-adventure, stealth game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective. The main narrative of the game follows Ratonhnaké:ton, also known as Connor, an 18th-century Assassin from Colonial America, and his involvement in various events during the American Revolution and the Revolutionary War. In the game's prologue, consisting of the first three main sequences, players control Connor's father Haytham Kenway, a British Templar, while in the modern-day sequences, the player character is series protagonist Desmond Miles, who searches for a way to protect the Earth from an upcoming solar flare on December 21, 2012. The game world consists of three main areas: Boston, New York City, and a large wilderness known as the Frontier (which is roughly 1.5 times bigger than Rome in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood). Portions of the Eastern Seaboard and Caribbean Sea can also be explored during the naval side missions.  Free running has been simplified to allow for more fluid parkour in the cities and wilderness, such as climbing and running on trees, mountains, cliffs, etc. Close combat has also been modified, allowing Connor to dual-wield weapons and take down multiple opponents at once and players no longer need to manage the lock-on mechanic. Aiding this, Connor has access to a wide range of weapons which include muskets, swords, pistols, native weapons such as the tomahawk and bow and arrow, the Rope Dart (used to pull foes or hang them from above) and the Assassins' signature Hidden Blades. Human shields can be used against firing lines of enemies. Medicine is no longer used as health recovers automatically. Stealth is also revamped, allowing players to use natural elements such as tall grass and trees to hide, along with the ability to blend between any two people.  Assassin's Creed III features new weather simulations such as snow, fog, and rain. The seasons can also change i.e., Summer and Winter, which not only affect visuals but also gameplay, as the player will find that they run slower in deep snow. Snowfall can reduce visibility for the player and enemies, aiding stealth. The game also features a wide variety of animals, both domestic (such as horses, cows, and dogs) and wild (deer, wolves, bears etc.). Wild animals are found in the Frontier and can be hunted for meat or marrow in order to be sold. The quality of the kill determines the price, encouraging the player to hunt silently. For this, traps and bait can also be used.  The economy is now based on the Davenport Homestead, which also acts as Connor's adoptive home. The site can be visited by people such as carpenters, tailors, etc. suffering from displacement due to the war. Helping and interacting with these non-player characters (NPCs) will encourage them to settle in the Homestead. From there on, the player can craft various items and trade with them, and then sell the goods to the cities via caravan. The player can also help them build relationships with each other, which will then result in the formation of a small community.  A revamped version of the recruitment system introduced in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood returns as players can enlist citizens to the Assassins' cause by completing optional ""Liberation"" missions. Unlike previous games, the player is limited to only six Assassin recruits, but these recruits are each given distinct personalities and backstories, and have a much larger skill set, allowing them to start riots, provide a cover escort, and set up an ambush, among others. Other side missions include collecting Benjamin Franklin's lost Almanac pages, exploring underground tunnels to unlock fast-travel stations, joining hunting and fighting clubs, investigating various frontiersman rumors like the UFOs and Sasquatches, and ""peg-legs"" missions in which Connor goes to underground forts and wastelands to uncover the legend of Captain Kidd's treasure. In addition, minigames such as Bowls, Checkers, Fanorona, and Nine men's morris are playable for the first time in the series.[9]  Assassin's Creed III introduced naval gameplay to the series. During the main story, Connor captains a brig, the Aquila, and is given the opportunity to upgrade it with improved weapons and hull armor. Control of the ship relies on environmental factors such as wind direction and speed, local presence of storms, high waves, and rocks. Engagements are by cannon, with broadsides covering both flanks of the ship, swivel guns that can be used to damage smaller ships which can also be boarded to find treasure, and chain shots from the broadsides as well to take down the masts of larger ships and disable them. The Aquila is usable only during a few main story missions and a series of dedicated side missions.  The Wii U version of the game has a few extra features, such as the ability to change weapons on the go and the map being always visible on the Wii U Gamepad. This version also supports Off TV Play, which redirects the main screen to the Wii U Gamepad.  Online multiplayer returns in this installment, developed by Ubisoft Annecy.[10] Along with returning modes, new ones feature a co-operative mode named Wolfpack, in which 1–4 players are charged with killing certain NPCs within a time limit, through a sequence of 25 stages. It also features Domination, a team mode where players will have to capture certain areas of the map, protecting them from the opposing team. Ubisoft announced that the multiplayer servers for Assassin's Creed III, alongside several other of their older titles, would be shut down on September 1, 2022. The date was later delayed to October 1, 2022.[11][12]  This renders all multiplayer-related achievements and trophies on the original console versions as unobtainable.  The Remastered version of the game features more revamped mechanics.[13] Players can now whistle from anywhere while hidden, whereas the original version only allowed whistling from corners. Double assassinations have been improved so as not to require entering high-profile mode to do so.[14] Free-aiming with ranged weapons was also made possible, allowing Connor more control over his bow and pistols. The mini-map and the UI were upgraded with better-looking and easier-to-recognize icons for ease of accessibility, figuring out where enemies will point next and also features color-blind modes.[15] The crafting system and the economy system was also vastly upgraded. The game's lighting system has been upgraded to resemble the new technology implemented in Assassin's Creed Origins and the textures have also been revamped to resemble those seen in the Assassin's Creed games utilizing the more advanced AnvilNext 2.0 engine.  "
80,Assassin's Creed Odyssey,/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_Odyssey," Assassin's Creed Odyssey is an action role-playing video game played from a third-person perspective. At the beginning of the game, the player can select to play as either Alexios or Kassandra,[1] Greek mercenaries and descendants of the Spartan king Leonidas I. In addition to completing the story campaign, players can freely explore a large open world set in Greece on foot or on horseback.[2] As the player explores the world, they will encounter various non-playable characters (NPCs) who give players side missions to complete.[3] They also discover locations of interests, clear out fortresses and camps, explore tombs and shipwrecks, and collect hidden treasures.[4][5] Synchronization points in various landmarks in Greece, which serve as fast travel points, can also be unlocked.[6] Players can also collect various crafting resources, such as iron ore, wood, leather, metal, and precious gems, through exploration and hunting wildlife.[7] Other side activities players can undertake include competing in a gladiatorial arena and completing time-limited bounties and contracts.[8][9] Unlike the previous games in the series, Odyssey offers two modes of gameplay: Guided mode shows the player the locations of their objects immediately using waypoints, while Exploration mode tasks players to find out the locations themselves after being given brief clues from other NPCs.[10][11]  While the main campaign missions follow the mercenary as they reunite their family and stop the Cult of Kosmos, additional questlines task the players to defeat mystical creatures from Atlantis and take down cultists.[12][13] As the game is set during the Peloponnesian War, Athens and Sparta control various parts of Greece. An area can be weakened if the player assassinates the nation leader, defeats members of their army, burns down war supplies, or pillages their nation chests.[14] When a region is weakened, players can join a conquest battle to aid either the attacking or the defending side. Winning a battle will earn the player valuable loots and gears.[15] Joining the attacking team is a more challenging experience but it will offer more gameplay benefits.[16] A bounty is placed on the player character if they commit a crime such as stealing or hurting an innocent bystander in public. NPCs called Mercenaries will then arrive to hunt the player character, who can either kill the mercenary, pay the bounty, or assassinate the character who place the bounty on them.[17] Each area has a recommended level. The player may be easily overpowered if they venture into an area too early. However, the game's difficulty is scaled in accordance to the player's level.[18][19] When interacting with other NPCs, players can select various dialogue options, including the option to develop a romantic relationship with some of them.[20] At key moments of the game's campaign, players make crucial decisions which can affect the course of the story and lead to several different endings.[21]  "
81,Assassin's Creed The Ezio Collection,/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_The_Ezio_Collection," The Assassin's Creed games are centered around one or more fictional members of the Order of the Assassins, whose memories are experienced by an in-game character in the modern-day period through the use of a device called the Animus and its derivations. The Animus allows the user to explore these memories passed down via genetics. Within the context of the game, this provides a diegetic interface to the real-world player of the game, showing them elements like health bars, a mini-map, and target objectives as if presented by the Animus. Additionally, should the player cause the historical character to die or fail a mission, this is rectified as ""desynchronization"" of the genetic memory, allowing the player to try the mission again. The Animus also imparts special abilities to the modern-day character that helps them to see their target in a crowd or other unique points of interest.  While playing as the Assassin characters, the games are generally presented from a third-person perspective in an open world environment, focusing on stealth and parkour. The games use a mission structure to follow the main story, generally assigning the player to complete an assassination of public figureheads or a covert mission. Alternatively, several side missions are available, such as mapping out the expansive cities from a high perch followed by performing a ""leap of faith"" into a haystack below, collecting treasures hidden across the cities, exploring ruins for relics, building a brotherhood of assassins to perform other tasks, or funding the rebuilding of a city through purchasing and upgrading of shops and other features. At times, the player is in direct control of the modern-day character who by nature of the Animus use has learned Assassin techniques through the bleeding effect, as well as their genetic ability of Eagle Vision, which separates friend, foe and assassination targets by illuminating people in different colors. Through the Animus interface, the player can go back to retry any past mission already completed; for example, in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, the player achieves better synchronization results by performing the mission in a specific manner such as by only killing the mission's target.  The games use the concept of ""active"" versus ""passive"" moves, with ""active"" moves, such as running, climbing the sides of buildings, or jumping between rooftops, more likely to alert the attention of nearby guards. When the guards become alerted, the player must either fight them or break their line of sight and locate a hiding place, such as a haystack or a well, and wait until the guards' alert is reduced. The combat system allows for a number of unique weapons, armor, and moves, including the use of a hidden blade set in a bracer on the Assassin's arm, and which also can be used to perform surreptitious assassinations.  "
83,Assault Android Cactus+,/wiki/Assault_Android_Cactus%2B," Assault Android Cactus is a twin stick shoot 'em up played primarily from a quarter-down perspective.[1][2] The Player takes control of one of nine Androids, the first of which being Cactus, an Interplanetary Police Department (IPPD) junior constable, who crashes her ship into a space freighter 'Genki Star'. The player must fight through hordes of rogue robots to take back control of the Genki Star.[1] The game can be played in single-player or in local cooperative play with up to four players.[3][2] The game features four game modes: a story, campaign, a challenging 50 layer mode, Infinity Drive, daily challenges, Daily Drive, and boss rush mode.[2] The game has nine playable androids to choose from,[2] each of which have a different combination of primary and secondary weapons.[1] The game includes 25 stages which morph and transform as the level progresses.[2][1]  "
89,Astral Chain,/wiki/Astral_Chain," Astral Chain is an action-adventure game where the player assumes the role of a detective from the ""Neuron"" special police task force, who are tasked with solving cases and investigating incidents that take place in ""The Ark"", the game's main world.[1] Exploring the world, questioning non-playable characters and examining evidence yields clues and logic puzzles that become ""leads"" which further the investigation process.[2] During the course of the game, the player will access the ""Astral Plane""—an interdimensional area where they must traverse hazardous terrain, solve puzzles, and battle enemies, similar to that of traditional video game dungeons.  Neuron officers are able to summon a tethered familiar known as a ""Legion"", bound by a chain that is the game's namesake. Legions come in various different forms sporting different abilities that are used both for puzzle-solving and combat. These include: a sword-based Legion with swift blade attacks that can be used to sever circuitry and interrupt enemy attacks, an archer Legion that can target weak points and distant switches, a Legion with powerful punches that can move large objects, an axe-based Legion which generates a shield and can destroy breakable objects and enemy shields, and a K9 Legion that can track scents, unearth hidden objects, and also be ridden for added mobility and evasiveness.[3] The player begins the game with the Sword Legion, capturing the other four over the course of the game. Legions can be swapped at any time during battle, and can also be upgraded via experience points and unlockable skills. On top of the player's own health, Legions have their own individual health meter that gradually depletes while they are summoned, and they are also susceptible to enemy attacks, which depletes higher amounts of their health. Their health regenerates automatically when they're not active. If the entirety of a Legion's health is depleted, the player becomes unable to utilize it until it has restored all of its health.  Combat takes place in real-time, both melee and ranged weapons are used to fight enemies, predominantly the malevolent race of ""Chimeras"". The player can summon the Legion during combat in order to have them automatically fight with the player to create combo attacks. The Legion can be manually directed with the right analog stick, allowing the player to position the Legion for more specific maneuvers. Each Legion also has a unique ""Legion Action"" that allows the player to take direct control over a Legion's signature ability, such as manually aiming and firing projectiles with the Archer Legion, or using the Arm Legion as protective armor that can hover over hazardous terrain and attack with a flurry of punches. Additional skills include being able to perform powerful health-restorative finishing moves, unchaining a Legion to summon multiple at once, using the chain that connects the player to the Legion in order to bind enemies—referred to as a ""Chain Bind""—and also using the chain as a tripwire on enemies that attempt charging into the player—referred to as a ""Chain Counter"". The player is also able to utilize the chain in order to zip line out of danger through enemy crowds, as well as crossing gaps and bottomless pits between buildings and platforms.  Completing combos, interrupting enemy attacks, restraining enemies, dodging, and deploying a Legion at the correct moment will offer the player a chance to perform a sync attack,[4] requiring the player to press the left trigger at the right instant, similar to a quick time event. Sync attacks can extend combos, trigger special attacks, bind enemies, and help the player recover from a fall. After performing a large number of sync attacks, the player may fuse with their Legion for a short while to recover health and deal large amounts of damage.  The game features four difficulty settings, allowing the player to switch difficulty between each chapter. The highest difficulty is only unlocked for a corresponding chapter once the player has beaten it once. When played on the two highest difficulties, the game ranks the player based on their individual case performance, giving the player an overall ranking at the end of each chapter. On the two lowest difficulties, the player will not be ranked.  Early in the game players unlock the IRIS tool, a heads up display from which they can inspect the environment and search for clues, as well as save their progress, manage the inventory, customize in-game menus, view the level map, and manage orders (benchmarks and photo challenges that reward the player with items, crafting materials, XP, money, and photo filters). Previously completed chapters can be accessed and replayed via the player's desk at the Neuron Headquarters at the beginning of each new chapter. The player can also return to this area to maintain and customize their Legions, customize their character, and interact with other Neuron officers. Consumable items can also be obtained from vendors that can later be used for crafting, health recovery, or combat.[2]   "
90,Astria Ascending,/wiki/Astria_Ascending," Astria Ascending primarily features two modes of play, which incorporate gameplay conventions and mechanics from the platformer and Japanese role-playing game genres. The player controls the on-screen character, a soldier named Ulan, from a 2D side-scrolling perspective. The player acquires quests through Ulan's dealings with non-player characters, and solves puzzles through her manipulation of environmental objects.[1] The game world of Astria Ascending features over 20 dungeons, and five unique cities.[2]  Players may approach or avoid enemies which are integrated into the open field; once Ulan touches an enemy, the screen transitions into a separate battle screen. Combat in Astria Ascending is turn-based, with players in full control of an active party of four combatants. During the player's turn, any party member may be swapped out with another from a selection of up to eight characters. Attack abilities are tied to different elemental attributes, which produces different results depending on a combatant character's individual strengths and weaknesses in relation to specific elements.  Astria Ascending occasionally depicts Ulan mounted on a flying creature in cutscenes and playable segments. Aerial combat levels where players take control of the flying mount feature scrolling shooter gameplay: using the creature's projectile weapon, which can be rotated between different elements, players must along the way battle waves of assorted flying enemies which respond differently to each variety of elemental attack. The weapon of Ulan's mount may be upgraded with greater capabilities if the player collects power-up items from slain enemies. To complete an aerial level, players must defeat the level's boss, and the player's score accumulated from defeated enemies is logged and displayed. Astria Ascending also features a collectible card-based minigame called ""J-Ster"", which is played as a strategic hexagonal board game.[2]  "
92,Astroneer,/wiki/Astroneer," Astroneer is a sandbox adventure game played from a third-person view. Its open world planets, wherein terraforming can take place, are subject to procedural generation, with the exception of some planet specific resources. The player controls an astronaut (called an Astroneer) who navigates on foot, by rover, through teleportation, or by spacecraft.   The game doesn't have any set storyline, but it does contain optional tasks and missions that can result in lore and narrative via cutscenes and data logs.  The player departs from a man-made satellite that is from an unknown planet and lands on Sylva, the starting planet. It is then up to the player to decide what to do. In order to advance the main storyline, the player must discover and activate an alien Gateway Chamber and dig into the planet. There are different subterranean layers with varying difficulty, most notably containing hazards and terrain that becomes harder as you dig deeper into the planet. Once the player reaches the last layer, they need to dig down from an alien pylon. They travel to the Gateway Engine and activate it with a material that progressively gets harder to obtain, depending on the difficulty of the planet. The player must obtain 2 Geometric Tryptics and place one on a  terminal on top of them and one to keep when they reach the satellite. The player can safely warp to any Gateway Chamber that they have activated. This process is repeated for the rest of the planets and moons, Desolo, Calidor, Vesania, Novus, Glacio, and Atrox, listed from easiest to hardest. Once the player has procured all 8 tryptics, they can travel to a Gateway Portal and place them in their respective slots. An Odd Stone will appear in the middle. Interacting with it will roll the end scene and credits.  It is also noted that there are other storylines which include, The Wanderer's Way mission, The Space Snail rescue mission, The Rails Update mission chain, Holiday Events, and numerous Easter Eggs.  "
106,Attack on Titan 2,/wiki/Attack_on_Titan_2," The game covers the plot of the first 50 chapters of Attack on Titan (also covered by the first two seasons of the anime adaptation), allowing the player to create an original character and interact with the characters of the manga.  The last mission of the game has an original ending, separate from both the anime and manga.  The DLC ""Final Battle"" covers chapters 51 to 90 of the manga (also covered by the third season of the anime).   The game features cel-shaded graphics and features the player defeating the titans in large, open areas. Key new features over the first title include a story-mode that's entirely playable in co-op, as well as a character creator.[3]  "

109,Axiom Verge,/wiki/Axiom_Verge," Axiom Verge is a side-scroller action-adventure game where the player controls Trace, a scientist who, after suffering a crippling injury, wakes up in an ancient and high-tech world. The game focuses on action and exploration, and features over 60 items and power-ups. The gameplay borrows elements from classic games such as Metroid, Contra, Blaster Master, and Bionic Commando, among others.[5]   After a lab explosion knocks him out, a scientist named Trace Eschenbrenner[6] awakens on the alien world of Sudra. He hears a voice speaking to him and fights his way to the source: a massive, mechanical head named Elsenova.  After Trace activates a power filter to partially restore Elsenova, she explains that the universe consists of many worlds which are separated by a storm called the Breach. Long ago, a man named Athetos came to Sudra through the Breach and eradicated its people using a pathogen. The only survivors of the pandemic were the Rusalki, a race of mechanical giants like Elsenova.  Trace activates a legion of drones to repair the Rusalki completely. On his way to a Rusalka named Ophelia, Trace hallucinates and collapses. While unconscious, Trace remembers that after the lab explosion, he remained on Earth and published theories that were ridiculed by the scientific community, giving him the nickname ""Athetos"". Ophelia confesses Trace is in fact another clone of him at a younger age. Trace expresses distrust of the Rusalka and demands to talk to Athetos, but Elsenova responds by remotely killing Trace.  Ophelia revives Trace, and they make an agreement where the Rusalki will let Athetos live if Trace merely shuts down his Breach attractor. Trace finds Athetos, who reveals that Sudra was once the gateway to a highly advanced alien world. By the time Athetos arrived however, the Sudrans had ceased to understand their role and now guarded their technology with religious reverence. Athetos planned to bring this alien technology back to Earth regardless, so he exterminated the Sudrans so they could not obstruct him. However, the Rusalki's survival halted Athetos' plan. Rather than let such powerful enemies roam free in the universe, Athetos attracted the Breach so that they could not leave Sudra.  Trace decides to fight Athetos and destroys the Breach attractor with a fully restored Elsenova's help. However, Elsenova claims Athetos is too dangerous and breaks her promise by killing him. The Rusalki tell Trace they will now return him home, and forcibly put him to sleep.  Trace awakens back on Earth after the lab accident, finding history has been altered so that the explosion did not injure him. However, Trace develops an obsession with returning to Sudra and quits his job to research it. If the player ends the game with a high completion rate, just as Trace is about to succeed on his research, Athetos himself appears. He tells Trace it is ""time to wake up"", and shoots him.  "
110,Axiom Verge 2,/wiki/Axiom_Verge_2," Just like its predecessor, Axiom Verge 2 is a side-scroller action-adventure game. The player controls Indra Chaudhari, a mysterious billionaire. The gameplay borrows elements from games from the 1980s and 1990s such as Metroid, Contra, Blaster Master, and Bionic Commando, among others.[citation needed] The game focuses on action and exploration, and features many items, enemies, and power-ups. Most of Indra's power-ups come in the form of ""Arms"", entities with various powers.[4] Indra battles enemies either with weapons such as axes and boomerangs[5] or by hacking them to alter their behaviors.[5][6] Her attributes such as health and attack power can be upgraded freely using Apocalypse Flasks scattered around the map.[6] Unusually for a Metroidvania, most bosses are optional and can be bypassed with no consequence to progression.[7][5]  Most of Axiom Verge 2 is set in the world of Kiengir, which is split into two parallel dimensions known as the ""Overworld"" and ""Breach"" respectively. The Overworld is larger and appears largely natural and akin to Earth, while the Breach appears more digital and can only be accessed by Indra in the form of an artificial drone. Indra is frequently required to move through the Breach to progress to its equivalent locations in the Overworld, and vice versa.[8]   In 2053, Indra Chaudhari, founder and CEO of the Globe 3 megacorporation, purchases Hammond Corp after its owner Elizabeth Hammond vanishes while carrying out research in Jones Station, Antarctica. The acquisition includes Hammond's original prototype for ansibles capable of zero-latency communication. Upon powering up the prototype, Indra receives a message from an unknown source telling her to come to Antarctica if she wishes to see her missing daughter again.  Indra explores Jones Station and is teleported via a cargo lift to a reality she does not recognize. She drowns in rising water, but finds herself reconstructed at a mysterious altar by an entity that introduces herself as Amashilama. Amashilama is an ""Arm"" – ""an intelligent collection of machines"" – that has bonded with Indra's body.  Indra finds the base camps of Hammond's research team. The researchers explain that they were studying this world – Kiengir – with Hammond until robots appeared and attacked the researchers, killing most of them and leaving the survivors isolated from each other. Furthermore, the cargo lift was destroyed so that it could no longer be used to leave Kiengir, and a group of Kazakh scientists from nearby Sagimbayev Station were never heard from again.  Indra acquires more Arms such as the sentient Damu, who can transfer Indra's consciousness to a small drone. She is horrified to learn that Damu was converted as a young child. The unknown person behind the ansible messages eventually reveals herself as Hammond. Indra also encounters the Lamassu, a highly advanced AI that released the robots to exterminate all humans on Kiengir and destroy the cargo lift. It explains that its actions are to prevent cross-contamination between separate universes, such as those of Earth and Kiengir.  Amashilama tricks Indra into giving the former control over the latter's body and trapping Indra's consciousness in Damu's drone form. Indra later acquires a humanoid replacement body and does battle with Amashilama, but both parties find that the advanced technology built by the native Sagiga will always prevent them from dying. The Lamassu explains Amashilama's plans: she will acquire an army of war machines known as Siuna and use them to raze the mother world A'ansur. Amashilama believes this will liberate Kiengir, but in actuality it would destroy both worlds and many others including Earth. Although it still distrusts Indra, the Lamassu decides Amashilama is a bigger threat, and gives Indra the mission to stop her using a single Siuna on Kiengir.  Indra finds both her daughter Samara and Hammond between universes, where they are trapped in a form of detention with countless other people. Hammond lets Indra speak with her daughter, but does not tell Indra how they ended up there out of concern for her mental health. Indra later finds Hammond's body on Kiengir; she had become trapped during the Lamassu's initial assault and died long before she could send her initial message to Indra. Amashilama assumes control of the Siuna Indra was pointed to and leaves the latter's original body limp on the ground. Seeing the apparently dead original Indra, the new one questions her own identity.  The new Indra prepares to a rig a powerful Breach bomb that will destroy the portal from Kiengir to A'ansur, but Amashilama intervenes and traps her in a force field after a battle. The original Indra suddenly arrives and attacks Amashilama, giving the new one time to arm the bomb and escape. The resulting explosion completely destroys both Amashilama, her Siuna, the old Indra, and the portal to A'ansur. The new Indra realizes she only wants to turn Damu back into a physical being and no longer cares about returning to Earth, and so joins the Kazakhs, who unbeknownst to the Hammond Corp team have transcended humanity. Pondering the death of the old Indra, the new one decides she can no longer call herself by that name but has become something else.  If the player finished the game with a high completion percentage, a post-credits scene shows the old Indra reuniting with Samara in the afterlife.  "
114,Azure Striker Gunvolt 3,/wiki/Azure_Striker_Gunvolt_3," Like the Mega Man series, namely the original series, Mega Man X, Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX, Azure Striker Gunvolt is a side-scrolling action platform game. The player controls the eponymous Gunvolt, who is able to jump, dash, and utilize a gun with special bullets that ""tag"" their targets, which grants a homing effect to Gunvolt's electric fields. Hitting an enemy with multiple tags will guide more of Gunvolt's electricity towards that enemy, increasing damage. The player's actions are limited by an energy bar, which depletes when using the electrical field, using additional movement abilities such as double-jumping or air dashing, or being hit by enemies. Whenever the energy bar is depleted, Gunvolt will enter an ""Overheat"" state and will be unable to use his septimal powers or defend himself until it refills.  focuses heavily on the player's technique and skill in moving through stages. While finishing a stage is relatively easy, the game provides a ranking system as well as several optional challenges. The game introduces a ""chain"" system in which the player's score is constantly increased so long as the player avoids being hit by enemies, with special actions such as defeating an enemy in the air or defeating multiple enemies at one time providing an additional bonus.[citation needed] The game uses an item-forging and equipping system, the former of which is instrumental in achieving the game's true ending.  Additionally, Gunvolt has access to several super move-like skills called Offensive Skills, which allow him to perform powerful attacks or heal himself. Each of the game's bosses also have their own Offensive Skills, which are triggered when their health bar drops below a certain level, or in the case of Elise, one of the bosses, when one of her halves is killed before the other. Speaking to Joule in Gunvolt's apartment in between stages also increases the chance of being brought back to life by Lumen when he dies in a stage, which gives Gunvolt unlimited Septimal energy, but at the cost of a higher stage ranking. Gunvolt can also level-up when he gains a certain amount of experience from defeating certain enemies.   Azure Striker Gunvolt is set during an unspecified date in the near future, in which several people called ""adepts"" have developed ""septimal powers"".[5] These powers enable superhuman feats including flight, the use of powerful energy weapons, and manipulation of the elements like fire, water, and electricity. The world is at peace thanks to the efforts of a world-spanning corporation known as the Sumeragi Group. However, the Sumeragi Group is, in reality, controlling and experimenting on adepts. Gunvolt, one of the most powerful adepts, has the ability to create electrical fields and works for an organization known as QUILL, which is seeking to reveal and put a stop to Sumeragi's ulterior motives.  The game opens with Gunvolt assigned on a mission to assassinate an adept named Lumen. He is told that Lumen has the ability to resonate with and control any adepts through her singing, and is considered dangerous. However, Gunvolt discovers that Lumen is the septimal projection of a young girl named Joule, who is a captive of Sumeragi's scientists, and can't bring himself to kill her. He instead rescues her, leading him to amicably defect from QUILL and set out on his own to protect her. He becomes a freelance agent, but still works jobs for QUILL from time to time.  Six months after defecting from QUILL, Gunvolt is offered a freelance assignment by Moniqa, his handler from QUILL, to investigate and take out several agents of the Sumeragi Group. The Sumeragi agents are all adepts as well, but powered by strange Glaives, which house their septimal essences, and are representative of each of the Seven Deadly Sins. The first agent, Merak, is a lazy, unenthusiastic adept with the power to bend space for use in his attacks. The second, Jota, is a prideful agent with the power to manipulate light. The third, Viper, is loud, brash, and violent, has control over fire, and harbors a jealous rage against Gunvolt for Joule. The fourth, Carerra, uses magnetic fists and waves to draw his enemies close before destroying them with a powerful pulsewave. The fifth, Elise, is a split personality adept: her meek, timid side and her brash, assertive side are at constant odds, but her ability to raise the dead allows for even adepts to come back from defeat. The sixth, Stratos, is a drug-addicted adept with an insatiable hunger for the very drug that keeps what little of his sanity remains in check, and has control over swarms of insects. The seventh, the carnal Zonda, attacks and wounds Zeno, one of Gunvolt's friends from QUILL, but is seemingly killed by a human warrior named Copen, who harbors a major hatred for adepts and carries a gun capable of firing bullets that can suppress their powers. Copen warns Gunvolt that they are not on the same side, and after a brief skirmish, retreats.  After defeating the Sumeragi agents, Gunvolt's apartment is invaded, and Joule is kidnapped by a resurrected Merak. Gunvolt gives chase, destroying Merak for good, and rides a space elevator to a Sumeragi orbiting platform. Along the way, he encounters the resurrected Stratos, Jota, and Viper and fights them all to the death, before finding that Elise herself had a hidden feral and wild third personality; responsible for the resurrection of the agents. This third personality is killed by Copen, and Gunvolt is forced to fight and subdue him. Gunvolt finally encounters the leadership of Sumeragi, a young psychic adept named Nova. He uses Lumen in combat against Gunvolt, before summoning Joule and three Glaives into himself to transform into a monstrous beast. Gunvolt manages to kill Nova and escape with Joule. In the initial ending, Gunvolt runs into Asimov, his father figure and the leader of QUILL, who offers Gunvolt and Joule new places in QUILL, and reveals an ulterior motive: with Sumeragi in shambles, Asimov wishes to use Lumen, along with the Sumeragi satellite, to wipe out the human race as payback for suppression of adepts. Gunvolt refuses his offer, telling Asimov that he is no better than Sumeragi was, and Asimov responds by shooting him through the heart using Copen's gun (implying that he defeated Copen to steal it from him), before turning the gun on Joule and shooting her as well, leaving them both for dead.  However, if Gunvolt is wearing a special pendant Joule made for him, which is made of collectable jewels that are hidden within each stage, this ending will be revealed as a dream and the true ending will occur instead. The true ending sees Gunvolt on the verge of death as in the initial ending, but he is then rescued by Lumen at the last minute. He awakens to find Joule's body, deathly cold and still. Heartbroken, Gunvolt screams in sadness until he hears Lumen's voice, and ultimately realizes that, in an act of love in order to save his life and be with him wherever he goes, Joule forsook her physical form by fusing her mind and personality with Lumen before further fusing herself into Gunvolt's septimal energy, which amplifies Gunvolt's power to its utmost limits. After this revelation, Gunvolt chases down Asimov, running into Carrera along the way. Carrera demands vengeance for his prior defeat, but is killed once and for all by Gunvolt. Continuing onward to the elevator, Gunvolt confronts Asimov, who reveals himself to have the same electrical septimal powers as Gunvolt. With no other choice, Gunvolt fights him to the death. Following this final battle, Asimov warns Gunvolt that he will never be truly free of conflicts in his life, and dies from his wounds. Zeno and Moniqa meet the space elevator as it arrives, only to find Asimov dead and a heartbroken, wounded Gunvolt, who offers no explanation as to what happened before he simply wanders away into the morning light to be alone with Joule.
